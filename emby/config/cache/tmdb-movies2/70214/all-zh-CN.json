In a time when the barriers of sexual morality and social convention have been broken down, Kay, Helen, Viv and Duncan enjoy a freedom never experienced before.  Moving back in time through the 1940s into the maelstrom of the Blitz, the lives, loves and losses of these four central characters are unravelled. For them, the post-war victory is bittersweet, for it returns them to the margins of society, from which they hoped they had been liberated. In order to build their future they must each make peace with their past.","popularity":5.511,"poster_path":"/7ayMrUTmt9FIqIOLrLZrlpWBFDX.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"BBC","id":3324}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Night Watch","vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":13,"casts":{"cast":[{"id":29236,"name":"Anna Maxwell Martin","character":"Kay Langrish","order":0,"cast_id":10,"profile_path":"/vBAsZPe1tHPvVLViiDWYkb5k1Cu.jpg"},{"id":120932,"name":"Claire Foy","character":"Helen Giniver","order":1,"cast_id":11,"profile_path":"/i8M7bLEJ2OF0P7GplTIEq46pA2J.jpg"},{"id":66431,"name":"Jodie Whittaker","character":"Vivian Pearce","order":2,"cast_id":12,"profile_path":"/3M4wgunSct5Lt2kNq29Vlvdz1aG.jpg"},{"id":145632,"name":"Anna Wilson-Jones","character":"Julia Standing","order":3,"cast_id":13},{"id":45051,"name":"Harry Treadaway","character":"Duncan Pearce","order":4,"cast_id":14,"profile_path":"/miinW3n8c2hZW9uy5FBfxO86f2H.jpg"},{"id":36663,"name":"Claudie Blakley","character":"Nancy Carmichael","order":7,"cast_id":4,"profile_path":"/bUy1X1ili9Goj3AQNrBD1kd7A8q.jpg"},{"id":26258,"name":"Kenneth Cranham","character":"Horace Mundy","order":8,"cast_id":17,"profile_path":"/9lzTbNgaoArlxpEkYtWQfOyiYwu.jpg"},{"id":565176,"name":"Jenna Augen","character":"Iris Knight","order":9,"cast_id":2},{"id":195609,"name":"Neal Barry","character":"Mr. Bryant","order":10,"cast_id":3,"profile_path":"/7HLA5uHIQvPpDTSpx91TtOiAqAL.jpg"},{"id":100738,"name":"Richard Cambridge","character":"Policeman","order":11,"cast_id":7},{"id":1029653,"name":"Tom Weston-Jones","character":"Jack Brown","order":12,"cast_id":8},{"id":165441,"name":"Liam Garrigan","character":"Reggie Nigri","order":13,"cast_id":18,"profile_path":"/5OXbMru5VPSlYDX4d4JIpfpnP2H.jpg"},{"id":30710,"name":"J.J.
