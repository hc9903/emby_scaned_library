Described as “Greek, Moresque, and Celtic with a dash of the Egyptian, the Persian, and the Japanese,” the room provided a fitting setting for one of the most eclectic and culturally curious artists in music today.  Amos performed a career-spanning set featuring classics from her debut Little Earthquakes through to Abnormally Attracted to Sin.  A candid interview with Tori is also included.  Tori Amos is one of the most influential and respected artists of the modern era.  The double-digit Grammy nominee has recorded 11 acclaimed studio albums (and gone platinum nearly 20 times) since emerging in the early ’90s.  She released two new CDs in 2009:Abnormally Attracted to Sin and her first seasonal project, Midwinter Graces.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bWuFsA8uwPtnGmvsF852W211zT1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tori Amos: Live from The Artists Den","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"casts":{"cast":[{"id":111164,"name":"Tori Amos","character":"Vocals, Piano","order":0,"cast_id":1}],"crew":[]},"releases":{"countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","certification":"","release_date":"2010-07-18T00:00:00.0000000Z"}]},"images":{"backdrops":[{"file_path":"/rhnmLChce4Idd8e326dkkT5HYoW.jpg","width":1280,"height":720,"aspect_ratio":1.777777777777778,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}],"posters":[{"file_path":"/bWuFsA8uwPtnGmvsF852W211zT1.jpg","width":1031,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","aspect_ratio":0.6873333333333334,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"trailers":{"quicktime":[],"youtube":[]}}
