But when Milly Farley looks at her daughter she sees something else: a tennis prodigy who could be Milly’s ticket to money and fame. Released in 1951, Hard, Fast and Beautiful foresaw our modern era of big-time women’s sports – and of driven parents who would stop at nothing to “help” their daughters grab the golden ring. Sally Forrest plays Florence, who finds athletic success but not happiness. Claire Trevor seethes with barely concealed malice and greed as Milly. And behind the camera is movie star Ida Lupino, guiding one of a series of low-budget, big-concept films that established her as a rarity in mid-century Hollywood: a successful and stylish female director.","popularity":1.458,"poster_path":"/cgfvFVhZ5XQEJMzADB2KnBTPJe4.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"The Filmakers","id":16511}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hard, Fast and Beautiful","vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":7,"casts":{"cast":[{"id":14965,"name":"Claire Trevor","character":"Millie Farley","order":0,"cast_id":2,"profile_path":"/81SIz8AcVH79Ci0J3H4M3SNs863.jpg"},{"id":84232,"name":"Sally Forrest","character":"Florence Farley","order":1,"cast_id":3,"profile_path":"/76Fy3OtQeUlHy5cw1K3bKbiuVdQ.jpg"},{"id":124090,"name":"Carleton G.
