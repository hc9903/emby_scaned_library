{"adult":false,"budget":0,"genres":[{"id":28,"name":"动作"}],"homepage":"","id":429643,"imdb_id":"tt0226269","original_title":"お仕置きハイヒール","overview":"A woman is being sexually assaulted by a pair of thugs, when out of the fog appear the High Heeled Cats – a trio of avenging angels, masked and dressed in black. These beautiful vigilantes make a living running a coffee shop by day, and kicking misogynist criminals in the balls by night. Their boss is an elderly lady offering a payback service to women who have been mistreated by men. The cops can’t be seen to allow this kind of behavior, but they are increasingly frustrated with the lack of clues that might lead to the identity of the trio – despite the fact that the two detectives on the case visit the coffee shop daily, to flirt with and grope the waitresses, and drink the occasional cup of coffee. The high heeled honeys eventually bite off more than they can chew when they get on the bad side of a ruthless gangster, who sets a creepy assassin on their trail.","popularity":0.6,"production_companies":[{"name":"Pink Pineapple","id":80856}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1995-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"お仕置きハイヒール","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"casts":{"cast":[{"id":1720848,"name":"Misuzu Saiki","character":"","order":0,"cast_id":0},{"id":1720849,"name":"Manami Morimura","character":"","order":1,"cast_id":1},{"id":1720850,"name":"Minori Sonoda","character":"","order":2,"cast_id":2},{"id":1016269,"name":"Tsutomu Hori","character":"","order":3,"cast_id":3},{"id":52716,"name":"Houka Kinoshita","character":"","order":4,"cast_id":19,"profile_path":"/wvUQ2f6B0VdKqCw57dDc5OFzcob.jpg"},{"id":1186800,"name":"Jtarô Sugisaku","character":"","order":6,"cast_id":5},{"id":1720852,"name":"Shima Yamashita","character":"","order":7,"cast_id":6},{"id":1488406,"name":"Saeko Ichijou","character":"","order":8,"cast_id":7},{"id":82878,"name":"Kenzo Hagiwara","character":"","order":9,"cast_id":8},{"id":551780,"name":"Michiyo Yokoyama","character":"the Madam","order":10,"cast_id":9,"profile_path":"/a5or0plbQ3ATGwTvZBfjYLQ9q8E.jpg"},{"id":1720854,"name":"Kojiro Sawai","character":"","order":11,"cast_id":10}],"crew":[{"id":555622,"name":"Mitsuo Matsukawa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"id":1719004,"name":"Toshio Yoshioka","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"id":1719010,"name":"Hisaaki Saito","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Technician"},{"id":1719011,"name":"Masami Nishioka","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"id":1720856,"name":"Akio Motojima","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"id":1720857,"name":"Hiroshi Kawasaki","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"id":1720858,"name":"Masato Miyano","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"id":1720859,"name":"Takashi Kodama","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"releases":{"countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","certification":"","release_date":"1995-02-03T00:00:00.0000000Z"}]},"images":{"backdrops":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"trailers":{"quicktime":[],"youtube":[]}}
