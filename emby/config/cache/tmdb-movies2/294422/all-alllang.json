Expelled from school and evicted from his apartment, he becomes one of Japan’s many ‘net cafe refugees’, barely scraping by each day with temporary and part-time work. Even though he’s still in Tokyo, his circumstances drive him to see and experience his home city in new ways. Trying to survive, Osamu gradually acquaints himself with the ‘invisible’ spaces occupied by the wanderers and homeless of Tokyo… people just like himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iSpMUtBriVdl1QRdu2iqLuqAORV.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Cine Move See","id":33786}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2014-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Scraping by in the Tokyo streets.","title":"Tokyo Refugees","vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"casts":{"cast":[{"id":229360,"name":"Aoi Nakamura","character":"Shu Tokieda","order":1,"cast_id":4},{"id":130653,"name":"Chihiro Otsuka","character":"Akane Hojo","order":3,"cast_id":6},{"id":1257215,"name":"Mizuki Yamamoto","character":"Rui","order":6,"cast_id":9,"profile_path":"/Ahc8nBPfYxusYffWvRDmhONn3vX.jpg"},{"id":1367226,"name":"Sho Aoyagi","character":"Junya","order":7,"cast_id":13,"profile_path":"/twlA8KRAqBTHKHlYQyB1GFr12Vp.jpg"},{"id":1024891,"name":"Akiyoshi Nakao","character":"Kojiro","order":8,"cast_id":14,"profile_path":"/9pjCB8ZmOE2jQhZsWjwpdVz59Yh.jpg"},{"id":506447,"name":"Nobuaki Kaneko","character":"Atsushi Kodama","order":9,"cast_id":15},{"id":1030338,"name":"Jun Inoue","character":"Suzumoto","order":10,"cast_id":16},{"id":1072316,"name":"Yûta Kanai","character":"Karube","order":11,"cast_id":17},{"id":227087,"name":"Motoki Ochiai","character":"Shun","order":12,"cast_id":18},{"id":1367227,"name":"Saburo Tamura","character":"Serizawa","order":13,"cast_id":19},{"id":1178879,"name":"Yôichi Okamura","character":"Naganuma","order":14,"cast_id":20},{"id":1367228,"name":"Nobuhiko Otani","character":"Mori","order":15,"cast_id":21},{"id":120918,"name":"Mitsuru Fukikoshi","character":"Araki","order":16,"cast_id":22,"profile_path":"/yxOvrBhUtptt2xCDZHlFbhKhtSV.jpg"},{"id":13256,"name":"Kanji Tsuda","character":"Police Officer","order":18,"cast_id":24,"profile_path":"/eG4eAvW6rN7aoF098WDnEWVl0DY.jpg"},{"id":1127066,"name":"Mantaro Koichi","character":"Kobayakawa","order":19,"cast_id":25},{"id":144949,"name":"Seiji Fukushi","character":"Police Officer","order":20,"cast_id":26}],"crew":[{"id":930414,"name":"Masaaki Usui","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"id":1060759,"name":"Kiyoshi Sasabe","department":"Directing","job":"Director","profile_path":"/c6OYn47UNmKiJMOgCGzoedPleb.jpg"},{"id":1312866,"name":"Takeshi Aoshima","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"id":1366905,"name":"Masaaki Sakae","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"releases":{"countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","certification":"","release_date":"2014-02-22T00:00:00.0000000Z"}]},"images":{"backdrops":[],"posters":[{"file_path":"/iSpMUtBriVdl1QRdu2iqLuqAORV.jpg","width":1106,"height":1575,"aspect_ratio":0.7022222222222222,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2981,"name":"homelessness"},{"id":7617,"name":"drop-out"},{"id":184998,"name":"film adaptation"}]},"trailers":{"quicktime":[],"youtube":[]}}
