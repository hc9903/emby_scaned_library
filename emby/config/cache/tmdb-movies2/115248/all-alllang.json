Mixing Miklós Jancsó imagery and a Sergio Leone narrative, this ballad-like saga opens with image of a lone horseman on the empty plain, riding past a rude gallows.  The film concerns the vengeful return of a legendary betyár (outlaw), briefly a hero to the local herdsmen who oppose the state building a canal across their grazing land. Although Szomjas works from ethnographic records and archival material, it is hardly surprising that this violent, primitivist film would be more popular with Hungarian audiences than critics. Replete with young guns, crooked sheriffs, tavern brawlers and hardbitten plug-uglies, this widescreen film is strikingly shot by Elémer Ragályi (cinematographer for most of Gyula Gazdag’s films)—a feast of loamy, autumnal colors.","popularity":0.915,"poster_path":"/dg9uCU4KT9GDkLkrYkfKTO8KwLR.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"MAFILM Hunnia Stúdió","id":11586}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1976-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wind Is Whistling Under Their Feet","vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"casts":{"cast":[{"id":53779,"name":"Đoko Rosić","character":"Farkos Csapó Gyurka","order":0,"cast_id":19,"profile_path":"/k3HjoFmcMwegBQoWhq7uXRPIqow.jpg"},{"id":125198,"name":"István Bujtor","character":"Mérges Balázs","order":1,"cast_id":20},{"id":1192102,"name":"Vladam Holec","character":"Jeles Matyi","order":2,"cast_id":6},{"id":42077,"name":"György Cserhalmi","character":"Jeles Matyi hangja","order":3,"cast_id":7},{"id":1097146,"name":"Irén Bordán","character":"Parti Bözsi","order":4,"cast_id":8,"profile_path":"/dmJeaXyqwGp4rS26m2brQUYMJ86.jpg"},{"id":89634,"name":"Gábor Reviczky","character":"Babák Ferkó","order":5,"cast_id":9}],"crew":[{"id":23614,"name":"Elemér Ragályi","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography","profile_path":"/A6kDNvOUArNUN3rEexEAQbmtiQ0.jpg"},{"id":233720,"name":"Éva Kármentõ","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"id":233723,"name":"Zsuzsa Vicze","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"id":1036795,"name":"Sebő Ferenc","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer","profile_path":"/1Gp52bdLKqBmYpnYfhAyW9XhzEa.jpg"},{"id":1060647,"name":"György Szomjas","department":"Directing","job":"Director","profile_path":"/egNXCOVKESPLskIcT6hQSLlhtm2.jpg"},{"id":1060647,"name":"György Szomjas","department":"Writing","job":"Writer","profile_path":"/egNXCOVKESPLskIcT6hQSLlhtm2.jpg"},{"id":1060649,"name":"Péter Zimre","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"id":1455102,"name":"János Bozsogi","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"id":1537318,"name":"Lajos Gulyás","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"id":1537318,"name":"Lajos Gulyás","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"id":1610978,"name":"Attila Ungvári","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"id":1805464,"name":"János Krajcsovics","department":"Art","job":"Set Decoration"}]},"releases":{"countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","certification":"","release_date":"1976-08-26T00:00:00.0000000Z"}]},"images":{"backdrops":[],"posters":[{"file_path":"/kCTcYxODxODol1v2TtI8APD86V0.jpg","width":708,"height":1009,"aspect_ratio":0.7016848364717542,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0},{"file_path":"/dg9uCU4KT9GDkLkrYkfKTO8KwLR.jpg","width":1000,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"hu","aspect_ratio":0.6666666666666666,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"trailers":{"quicktime":[],"youtube":[]}}
