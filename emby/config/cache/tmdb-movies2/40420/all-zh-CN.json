Posing as the prostitute's long-lost brother \"Antonio Cerruti,\" he discovers a mare's nest of police corruption. In fact, in this comedy thriller the whole town is corrupt. If they were closely examined, Stan's methods for pursuing this investigation might embarrass the police. For instance, he drives into a criminal's house in a fancy, expensive race car. In another incident, he callously blows up a casino owned by Musard , one of the town's crime bosses. On that occasion, he first forces Musard to remove his clothes, and the poor criminal watches his casino explode from across the square while standing naked in a phone booth. Meanwhile, Stan seduces the lovely Edmonde.","popularity":6.884,"poster_path":"/bXGSFer2I5EUnlb7pbQxLftSQmc.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Gaumont","id":9}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1979-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"警察还是阿飞","vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":76,"casts":{"cast":[{"id":3829,"name":"Jean-Paul Belmondo","character":"Antonio Cerutti / Stanislas Borovitz","order":0,"cast_id":5,"profile_path":"/1XNXClPazdrXenfwTnWkBEBqhBD.jpg"},{"id":19632,"name":"Georges Géret","character":"Theodore Musard","order":1,"cast_id":6,"profile_path":"/b8cIQk0sxwnF4snfMuG1S8lnH7V.jpg"},{"id":35527,"name":"Jean-François Balmer","character":"Inspecteur Massard","order":2,"cast_id":7,"profile_path":"/5CLhlqqDJMjTx8t9ZkAyNwRBzQR.jpg"},{"id":25076,"name":"Claude Brosset","character":"Achille Volfoni","order":3,"cast_id":8,"profile_path":"/u2TEqxC1TwE7WdxYIXkrYTZi9Tf.jpg"},{"id":262075,"name":"Julie Jézéquel","character":"Charlotte","order":4,"cast_id":10,"profile_path":"/gT8xNBN2xhP2JqN44qklXqUshHK.jpg"},{"id":24629,"name":"Michel Galabru","character":"Grimaud","order":5,"cast_id":11,"profile_path":"/f6uvYIfc6cgQkn713rViFXIUCn0.jpg"},{"id":39644,"name":"Marie Laforêt","character":"Edmonde Puget-Rostand","order":6,"cast_id":12,"profile_path":"/vn6ZiZWC9O7FjHbiEbfFSXFC0G1.jpg"},{"id":23480,"name":"Henri Attal","character":"Le chef de transmission","order":7,"cast_id":13,"profile_path":"/cQTa563ohAzzA1Nej7OvB1Qmuz1.jpg"},{"id":18560,"name":"Michel Beaune","character":"Marcel Langlois","order":8,"cast_id":14,"profile_path":"/f3e1ACJvzz1fxrZkzOkeJ6ebU19.jpg"},{"id":35887,"name":"Catherine Lachens","character":"Simone Langlois","order":9,"cast_id":15},{"id":22312,"name":"Venantino Venantini","character":"Mario","order":10,"cast_id":16,"profile_path":"/pWBt1ipKBrry5YOSTasOZaLf44f.jpg"},{"id":55920,"name":"Charles Gérard","character":"Cazauban","order":11,"cast_id":17,"profile_path":"/f7ImmSsUKajeS1BVtEMCYJXHmlR.jpg"},{"id":278368,"name":"Philippe Castelli","character":"L'inspecteur du permis de conduire","order":12,"cast_id":18,"profile_path":"/wibBdQJ8ILvQ5aR1MhxNMbqXpxr.jpg"},{"id":37745,"name":"Tony Kendall","character":"L'inspecteur Rey","order":13,"cast_id":19,"profile_path":"/t28IGryL4XAXDq6z2n9FhaghbBz.jpg"}],"crew":[{"id":18563,"name":"Georges Lautner","department":"Directing","job":"Director","profile_path":"/9eX5ACCAv7nroWLValxB5qxgUt7.jpg"},{"id":49856,"name":"Michel Grisolia","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"releases":{"countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","certification":"","release_date":"1979-03-28T00:00:00.0000000Z"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","certification":"","release_date":"1979-04-04T00:00:00.0000000Z"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","certification":"16","release_date":"1979-06-21T00:00:00.0000000Z"}]},"images":{"backdrops":[{"file_path":"/v4IYpvcpfs34FShpJ2h0YkS4ol6.jpg","width":1920,"height":1080,"aspect_ratio":1.777777777777778,"vote_average":5.312,"vote_count":1}],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"trailers":{"quicktime":[],"youtube":[]}}
