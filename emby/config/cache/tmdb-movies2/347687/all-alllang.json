She finds it dull because she's got to sit at the castle's ticket office and sell tickets. That is, until the arrival of the new tour guide, Petr, a young history student. She falls in love at first sight. But for Petr she's just a young crazy girl. Katka tries to get Petr's attention in various ways, but all in vain. She makes a last ditch effort by pretending to steal some rare castle steins from the castle's collection. It's only after some detectives arrive that Katka realizes that she may have overdone it, but she finally manages to get Petr to notice her.","popularity":1.37,"poster_path":"/dqqahtVJf9T17GXpfJkT5U5shRZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Filmové Studio Gottwaldov","id":2331}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"1981-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daisies for the Lady of the Manor","vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"casts":{"cast":[{"id":1485008,"name":"Sylva Julinová","character":"Katka","order":1,"cast_id":5},{"id":83952,"name":"Jan Hartl","character":"Petr","order":2,"cast_id":6},{"id":575103,"name":"Zdena Hadrbolcová","character":"matka Katky","order":4,"cast_id":8},{"id":1136099,"name":"Tomáš Vacek","character":"Tonda","order":5,"cast_id":9},{"id":130885,"name":"Pavel Kříž","character":"Robert","order":6,"cast_id":10,"profile_path":"/a1lMm8jQn8U1xVOqunkDRJ1FY6N.jpg"},{"id":97193,"name":"Eva Holubová","character":"Hanka","order":7,"cast_id":11,"profile_path":"/qg4JECC9lTm5jjX8lyvjt7MBac.jpg"},{"id":77379,"name":"Jiří Růžička","character":"Kvasnička","order":8,"cast_id":12,"profile_path":"/fI9oDJ4RG2TZEH80oCLK7Bj3jjd.jpg"},{"id":222524,"name":"Jana Tomšů","character":"Ida","order":9,"cast_id":13},{"id":1436649,"name":"Antonín Navrátil","character":"policista","order":10,"cast_id":14,"profile_path":"/8F4d0jyXL7XpWgCHDaAqgmtVELq.jpg"},{"id":213324,"name":"Lubor Tokoš","character":"dědeček","order":11,"cast_id":15,"profile_path":"/8ifpIU3zVCDSsu8fpQcJknRZPTy.jpg"},{"id":544880,"name":"Josef Chvalina","character":"učitel","order":12,"cast_id":16},{"id":137021,"name":"Věra Tichánková","character":"babička","order":13,"cast_id":17},{"id":1192430,"name":"Jiří Tomek","character":"policista","order":14,"cast_id":18,"profile_path":"/2YKEt5qgzjbVc5XhNA9DxjXSKTz.jpg"},{"id":84002,"name":"František Husák","character":"otec Katky","order":15,"cast_id":19,"profile_path":"/mQnknsKOf69V5cm3GI79x09i5lD.jpg"}],"crew":[{"id":54012,"name":"Ivan Matouš","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"id":56134,"name":"Karel Svoboda","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"id":222519,"name":"Jaroslav Petřík","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"id":1306190,"name":"Vojtěch Kunčík","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"id":1461209,"name":"Josef Pinkava","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"id":1461209,"name":"Josef Pinkava","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"id":1461210,"name":"Jiří Kolín","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"id":1461212,"name":"Zdeněk Rozkopal","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"id":1689425,"name":"Josef Vojtásek","department":"Art","job":"Set Decoration"},{"id":1689426,"name":"Kristina Novotna","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"}]},"releases":{"countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","certification":"","release_date":"1981-09-01T00:00:00.0000000Z"}]},"images":{"backdrops":[],"posters":[{"file_path":"/dqqahtVJf9T17GXpfJkT5U5shRZ.jpg","width":1181,"height":1772,"iso_639_1":"cs","aspect_ratio":0.6664785553047404,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"trailers":{"quicktime":[],"youtube":[]}}
