at Nuremberg","overview":"由斯潘塞．特蕾西、理查德．威德马克等联合主演的本片是一部群星戏。讲述二战后在纽伦堡提审德国纳粹计划的法律关系者，三个被告提审的原因是给犹太人施行断种手术。担任主审判长的是美国人赫鲁特，他主张其中两个被告无罪；而德国司法部长亚林克竟对此事保持沉默，但检查官罗森上校却激烈的指责被告，因此三个人展开激烈的辩论。审讯继续进行下去。而美国的高级官员们希望能在审判中获提德国所犯罪行的良好证明，因此对审判施以极大的压力，但赫鲁特坚守法律的正义立场，给予了最公正的判决。在宣布判决结果时，只有亚林对赫鲁特审判长的态度表示赞赏。这部电影是社会派制作人斯坦利．克雷默将赫鲁特审判长的回忆录搬上银幕，拍摄而成的，以突出的演技来表现伦理与伦理间的纠缠关系。此片获得最佳男主角金像奖及最佳改编剧本奖。","popularity":9.746,"poster_path":"/cqumfgd74ftVzOKJpFGOG64WlXL.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"United
