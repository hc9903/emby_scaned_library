Hoffman 配音）写了一封信询问美国小孩从哪里来，并附上一根樱桃巧克力棒。44岁的马克思患有自闭症及肥胖，碰巧也喜欢看“诺布利特”动画片及吃巧克力。二人的笔友关系从1976年维持到1994年，期间各自经历了许多人生起伏，直到成年的玛丽（托妮·科莱特 Toni Collette 配音）终于来到纽约看望马克思……　　本片获2009年法国昂锡国际动画影展最佳动画长片奖，柏林国际电影节水晶熊奖及渥太华国际动画电影节最高奖。","popularity":11.239,"poster_path":"/b4LKlquh0ls5Rgb27QLPlkC7Oya.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"icon","id":4096}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2009-02-09","revenue":1725381,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"玛丽和马克思","vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":1150,"casts":{"cast":[{"id":3051,"name":"Toni
