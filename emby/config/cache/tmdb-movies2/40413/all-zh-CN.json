Both of the female hikers are seeking love, though one of them is involved with their married guide and tries to push him into getting a divorce. The other, a former actress, simply wants the perfect mate. Neither of the two male hikers, one who is involved with an Australian and the other is in love with making money, qualify for her affections.","popularity":5.052,"poster_path":"/hsX9iRCsFc2Eaak41bZi928Fo4k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1997-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Randonneurs","vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":114,"casts":{"cast":[{"id":47820,"name":"Benoît Poelvoorde","character":"Éric Jacquemart","order":0,"cast_id":12,"profile_path":"/1rt37BkFjSYF7imtvJ5t30bqsNM.jpg"},{"id":54918,"name":"Vincent Elbaz","character":"Mathieu Lacaze","order":1,"cast_id":7,"profile_path":"/uj2N223BJ1V78W8mNK20M3IGYus.jpg"},{"id":13688,"name":"Karin Viard","character":"Coralie","order":2,"cast_id":10,"profile_path":"/o12F6rIgJNPAyJa1aUsFSntRmf.jpg"},{"id":19888,"name":"Géraldine Pailhas","character":"Nadine","order":3,"cast_id":8,"profile_path":"/yPHgSmVJuS7Xub2WLtaYyd6Osjz.jpg"},{"id":123979,"name":"Philippe Harel","character":"Louis Lacaze","order":4,"cast_id":4},{"id":5445,"name":"Zinedine Soualem","character":"L'animateur","order":5,"cast_id":13,"profile_path":"/feyQoQ89GDPnnmbeiiVFHkJvQtH.jpg"},{"id":40264,"name":"Marine Delterme","character":"Bernadette","order":6,"cast_id":14,"profile_path":"/sSsOshLofNpk0NYdkp0fVD313ya.jpg"},{"id":27637,"name":"Clara Bellar","character":"Eve","order":7,"cast_id":15},{"id":580574,"name":"Vicky Albertini","character":"la première belle randonneuse","order":8,"cast_id":16},{"id":580575,"name":"Michel Casang","character":"premier contact","order":9,"cast_id":17},{"id":580576,"name":"Etienne Castelane","character":"le chauffeur de la camionnette","order":10,"cast_id":18},{"id":580577,"name":"Alexis Ceccaldi","character":"le 2ème compagnon des randonneuses","order":11,"cast_id":19},{"id":580578,"name":"Pascal Ceccaldi","character":"le 1er compagnon des randonneuses","order":12,"cast_id":20},{"id":580579,"name":"Franck Crombet","character":"le fiancé d'Eve","order":13,"cast_id":21},{"id":580580,"name":"Éric Houzelot","character":"l'oncle chauvin","order":14,"cast_id":22},{"id":1217200,"name":"Louise Germaine","character":"Jennifer","order":15,"cast_id":28}],"crew":[{"id":63896,"name":"Eric Assous","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"id":123979,"name":"Philippe Harel","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"id":123979,"name":"Philippe Harel","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"id":1172624,"name":"Dodine Herry","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"id":1172625,"name":"Nelly Ryher","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"}]},"releases":{"countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","certification":"U","release_date":"1997-03-12T00:00:00.0000000Z"}]},"images":{"backdrops":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"trailers":{"quicktime":[],"youtube":[]}}
