From being the best home-school principal, to an 8-track cassette lover through and through, Tim explores the insanity of our technology crazed world. Tim also explains the difficulty of eating well in our fast-food culture- especially when you have a thing for doughnut glaze. With a bunch of great new material, Act 2 of Bananas Featuring Tim Hawkins is more than just stand up comedy. It's a variety show featuring interviews of the not-so-serious kind, as well as some hilarious unscripted moments caught on tape. Best of all, it's good clean fun for the entire family!","popularity":0.672,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bananas - Tim Hawkins, Act 2","vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":2,"casts":{"cast":[{"id":591950,"name":"Tim Hawkins","character":"Himself","order":0,"cast_id":1}],"crew":[]},"releases":{"countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","certification":"NR","release_date":"2009-03-10T00:00:00.0000000Z"}]},"images":{"backdrops":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"trailers":{"quicktime":[],"youtube":[]}}
