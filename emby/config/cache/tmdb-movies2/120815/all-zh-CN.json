The needle in a haystack plot seems to involve our protagonist rescuing his family from some South American drug cartel, or something. At one point Carradine yells those immortal words: \"get the hell out of here\" through closed lips. The villain of the piece never utters a line of dialogue, preferring instead to stalk about in a cape, squinting cannily beneath beret and drooping mustache (with hawk perched on shoulder for added effect). Avoid at all costs, unless you enjoy beating yourself repeatedly over the head with a flail.","popularity":1.564,"poster_path":"/vUlfUWjV3WXzmc8GXjQx9PUenUI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Open Fire","vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":3,"casts":{"cast":[{"id":141,"name":"David Carradine","character":"Joe Rourke","order":0,"cast_id":1,"profile_path":"/u6C8DVrC9QgQEovlWLIBob8gvgZ.jpg"},{"id":119438,"name":"Henry Yu Yung","character":"Master Ly (as Bruce Ly)","order":1,"cast_id":6},{"id":38764,"name":"Hugo Stiglitz","character":"Don Gaspar","order":2,"cast_id":4,"profile_path":"/8G3HcfAPMkki1YqiaGthLeveTsr.jpg"},{"id":106478,"name":"Christine Lunde","character":"Morgan","order":3,"cast_id":7},{"id":1074592,"name":"Kansas Carradine","character":"Gina Rourke","order":4,"cast_id":5},{"id":173264,"name":"Wanda Acuna","character":"Linda","order":5,"cast_id":8,"profile_path":"/b9iRUb9nMUfztUJLmXB6oY0uzQ7.jpg"},{"id":1152416,"name":"Jorge Reynoso","character":"1st Lieutenant","order":6,"cast_id":9,"profile_path":"/kKYwE7j5nAtPJZ9sY9Z5VY4gTh7.jpg"},{"id":963606,"name":"Julio Aldama Jr.","character":"Sheriff Roca","order":7,"cast_id":10,"profile_path":"/AmeG2x63XaMBKtnaHj25YmhXGe1.jpg"},{"id":104137,"name":"Anaís de Melo","character":"Panther","order":8,"cast_id":11,"profile_path":"/cOOt9eowieQPnpfTRvAh0VhPU9J.jpg"},{"id":1044093,"name":"Agustín Bernal","character":"Commando","order":9,"cast_id":12,"profile_path":"/j0uBfKiKQSdR9IS7vE4rjPWULfQ.jpg"},{"id":1700247,"name":"Adalberto Arvizu","character":"Commando","order":10,"cast_id":13}],"crew":[{"id":1072779,"name":"Roger Mende","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"releases":{"countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","certification":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.0000000Z"}]},"images":{"backdrops":[],"posters":[{"file_path":"/vUlfUWjV3WXzmc8GXjQx9PUenUI.jpg","width":604,"height":912,"iso_639_1":"en","aspect_ratio":0.6622807017543859,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10175,"name":"drug cartel"}]},"trailers":{"quicktime":[],"youtube":[]}}
