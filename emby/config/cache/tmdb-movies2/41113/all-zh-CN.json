The presenter, Richard Hammond, spends four days with former motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel. Knievel, by now 69 years old, had become very ill, requiring an oxygen tank strapped up to him constantly to aid with breathing. 48 hours before the film crew arrived, Knievel had a stroke. At several points during filming, Knievel cuts the interview short and leaves before Hammond has finished asking questions.","popularity":3.844,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Richard Hammond Meets Evel Knievel","vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":2,"casts":{"cast":[{"id":82658,"name":"Richard Hammond","character":"himself","order":0,"cast_id":1,"profile_path":"/lan8GILdlwl4FJp0MIFkEmwWwOn.jpg"},{"id":996568,"name":"Robert Craig Knievel","character":"Himself","order":1,"cast_id":2}],"crew":[]},"releases":{"countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","certification":"","release_date":"2007-12-23T00:00:00.0000000Z"}]},"images":{"backdrops":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"trailers":{"quicktime":[],"youtube":[]}}
