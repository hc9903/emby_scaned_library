Ever Happened to Baby Jane?","overview":"　　宝贝·珍妮·汉德森（贝蒂·戴维斯 Bette Davis 饰）曾是风靡一时的童星，整个汉德森家都依靠她的收入过活，这使她的性格变得日益扭曲和跋扈。比起珍妮，作为姐姐的布兰奇·汉德森（琼·克劳馥 Joan Crawford 饰）不过是一只不足挂齿的丑小鸭，不仅妹妹对自己视若无睹，就连父亲对她都大呼小叫态度恶劣，忍气吞声的布兰奇在心中埋下了仇恨的种子。成年后的姐妹两地位发生了逆转，珍妮的愚蠢和怪癖让她逐渐过气，而颇有姿色的布兰奇倒是在演艺圈获得了空前的成功，尽管布兰奇处处提携珍妮，但珍妮无法平衡内心的落差，总是想方设法和姐姐作对。\r 　　一场突如其来的车祸使得布兰奇永远失去了双腿，珍妮也因此变得疯疯癫癫，布兰奇想把珍妮送进医院，珍妮却想消抹布兰奇的存在，彻底的取代她的位置。最亲近的两个女人在一处隐秘的别墅里开始了相互折磨的生活，而在这生活之下，似乎还隐藏着什么不可告人的秘密。","popularity":7.44,"poster_path":"/iL3NPfhVvZNW4HPBToRuk3DlXdV.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Associates
