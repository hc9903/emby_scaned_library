The administration is concerned mainly with forms and rules (there's an up and and a down staircase); bells ring at the wrong time. Nevertheless, she tries. How she handles the chaos and her despair in her first semester makes up the film: a promising student drops out, another sleeps through class, a girl with a crush on a male teacher gets suicidal, and a bright but troublesome student misunderstands Sylvia's reaching out. A discussion of Dickens, parents' night, and a mock trial highlight the term. Can she make it?","popularity":2.541,"poster_path":"/qkPelPF6HteiI33nrj5s5QKasAk.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Park Place Production","id":27756}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Up the Down Staircase","vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":8,"casts":{"cast":[{"id":18365,"name":"Sandy Dennis","character":"Sylvia Barrett","order":0,"cast_id":3,"profile_path":"/hy3QacaLrl2GtSPKmZtgSIQJfJG.jpg"},{"id":153112,"name":"Patrick Bedford","character":"Paul Barringer","order":1,"cast_id":4},{"id":40618,"name":"Eileen Heckart","character":"Henrietta Pastorfield","order":2,"cast_id":5},{"id":8493,"name":"Ruth White","character":"Beatrice Schacter","order":3,"cast_id":6,"profile_path":"/bsAHZQuh9XtWQoBalne2yTia7gt.jpg"},{"id":28933,"name":"Jean Stapleton","character":"Sadie Finch","order":4,"cast_id":7,"profile_path":"/azktphexJKmo8dMKKFSf9Vj5RV4.jpg"},{"id":40191,"name":"Sorrell Booke","character":"Dr. Bester","order":5,"cast_id":8},{"id":1230012,"name":"Roy Poole","character":"Mr. McHabe","order":6,"cast_id":23},{"id":84323,"name":"Florence Stanley","character":"Ellen Friedenberg","order":7,"cast_id":10,"profile_path":"/yTntdhPTbELMrqjgdEftDFw8WSD.jpg"},{"id":1195366,"name":"Ellen O'Mara","character":"Alice Blake","order":8,"cast_id":11},{"id":1195367,"name":"Jeff Howard","character":"Joe Ferone","order":9,"cast_id":12},{"id":81552,"name":"Vinnette Carroll","character":"The Mother","order":10,"cast_id":13},{"id":1195368,"name":"Martha Greenhouse","character":"Mrs. Kagan","order":11,"cast_id":14},{"id":36926,"name":"Frances Sternhagen","character":"Charlotte Wolf, school librarian","order":12,"cast_id":15,"profile_path":"/4eJzKYiAiQBPAHxJVgkdcNbXEnG.jpg"},{"id":151133,"name":"Elena Karam","character":"School nurse","order":13,"cast_id":16},{"id":1195370,"name":"Maria Landa","character":"Carole Blanca","order":14,"cast_id":17},{"id":1195371,"name":"Candace Culkin","character":"Linda Rosen","order":15,"cast_id":18},{"id":1195372,"name":"Lew Wallach","character":"Lou Martin","order":16,"cast_id":19},{"id":1195373,"name":"Salvatore Rasa","character":"Harry A.
