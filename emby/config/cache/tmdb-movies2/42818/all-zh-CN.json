Colorful characters abound: M. Panisse, an aging widower and prosperous sail maker; Honorine, a fishmonger with a sidewalk stall near the bar; her daughter, Fanny, who helps her sell cockles; and, various old salts. Friends since childhood, Fanny and Marius love each other, but Marius has a secret wanderlust: every ship's whistle stirs a longing for foreign lands. When M. Panisse seeks Fanny's hand in marriage and when a departing clipper needs a deckhand, Marius and Fanny must decide who and what they love most. César, with his generous, comic spirit, tries to guide his son.","popularity":3.294,"poster_path":"/ps1muCHhshYENzidJKb8k7gtSw0.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Les Films Marcel Pagnol","id":19160}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1931-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"马里乌斯","vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":32,"casts":{"cast":[{"id":239231,"name":"Raimu","character":"Cesar Ollivier","order":0,"cast_id":3,"profile_path":"/oFCzjEbNFNwGG8oIggETFNPW610.jpg"},{"id":11546,"name":"Pierre Fresnay","character":"Marius Ollivier","order":1,"cast_id":6,"profile_path":"/ukt3W6FiJpFrWxR3CuLS2cgVpkH.jpg"},{"id":564273,"name":"Orane Demazis","character":"Fanny Cabanis","order":2,"cast_id":5,"profile_path":"/17lnKxftNbfO3Zi99vWDiRn1upt.jpg"},{"id":94939,"name":"Fernand Charpin","character":"Honoré Panisse","order":3,"cast_id":4,"profile_path":"/til2Tyu3BWeZ3ObIkp0cYKuCjqQ.jpg"},{"id":584135,"name":"Alida Rouffe","character":"Honorine Cabanis","order":4,"cast_id":18},{"id":588717,"name":"Paul Dullac","character":"Félix Escartefigue","order":5,"cast_id":19,"profile_path":"/5pUkMmLbE6mj2GP9gQbdF8cZhNY.jpg"},{"id":117901,"name":"Robert Vattier","character":"Monsieur Brun","order":6,"cast_id":7,"profile_path":"/kMqtAvukwmZbll1VITuoeXBDle8.jpg"},{"id":11600,"name":"Alexandre Mihalesco","character":"Piquoiseau","order":7,"cast_id":20,"profile_path":"/bLjYg308A9ddlnUJlbOwTaASZyH.jpg"},{"id":588733,"name":"Milly Mathis","character":"Claudine Foulon, tante de Fanny","order":8,"cast_id":21}],"crew":[{"id":2490,"name":"Alexander Korda","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"id":27937,"name":"Alfred Junge","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"id":33261,"name":"Vincent Korda","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"id":38393,"name":"Marcel Pagnol","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay","profile_path":"/c9wikscPoPFialtPqepw8Df0D0l.jpg"},{"id":38393,"name":"Marcel Pagnol","department":"Production","job":"Producer","profile_path":"/c9wikscPoPFialtPqepw8Df0D0l.jpg"},{"id":38393,"name":"Marcel Pagnol","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play","profile_path":"/c9wikscPoPFialtPqepw8Df0D0l.jpg"},{"id":106015,"name":"Theodore J.
