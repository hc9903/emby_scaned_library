He was a rascal, baffling his father, always in trouble, and in love with Valentina, a neighbor girl. On his roof top at night he sends semaphore messages to her. He writes poems. He gets them into trouble, killing her father's breeding pigeons. When the two families camp at a decaying castle, his tutor, a sympathetic priest, tells him about the most valiant men, the saints, the heroes, and the poets. Already a poet, he learns a lesson about being a hero.","popularity":2.272,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1982-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Valentina","vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":9,"casts":{"cast":[{"id":5401,"name":"Anthony Quinn","character":"Mosen Joaquín","order":0,"cast_id":1001,"profile_path":"/mLlpsh0S44vovYAxbVxvu5b4xaW.jpg"},{"id":145414,"name":"Jorge Sanz","character":"Pepe","order":1,"cast_id":1002,"profile_path":"/8MmH5A2zDHCdFyA691nn6xJY49I.jpg"},{"id":588873,"name":"Paloma Gómez","character":"Valentina","order":2,"cast_id":1003},{"id":1244175,"name":"María Rubio","character":"Valentina adulta","order":3,"cast_id":1034},{"id":1063555,"name":"Saturno Cerra","character":"Don José","order":4,"cast_id":1004,"profile_path":"/7a7kTmT5yRUx9RBYdmroDynIG6G.jpg"},{"id":1315599,"name":"Concha Leza","character":"Doña Luisa","order":5,"cast_id":1005},{"id":97656,"name":"Alfred Lucchetti","character":"Don Arturo","order":6,"cast_id":1006},{"id":227994,"name":"Marisa de Leza","character":"Doña Julia","order":7,"cast_id":1007,"profile_path":"/lHcyOXaWzIDUfSc59oBXodvTDec.jpg"},{"id":34629,"name":"Eusebio Poncela","character":"Narrador","order":8,"cast_id":1008,"profile_path":"/pCbXRk44XYJzWDzYybAco5dlGF7.jpg"},{"id":143227,"name":"Concha Hidalgo","character":"Tía Ignacia","order":9,"cast_id":1009,"profile_path":"/eEfHwenpa7QhuAKg7hfWv26X875.jpg"},{"id":37525,"name":"Luis Ciges","character":"Médico","order":10,"cast_id":1010},{"id":1054007,"name":"Emilio Fornet","character":"Pastor","order":11,"cast_id":1012,"profile_path":"/q4RZZpgxT8zXtyFiD7zNT25GWUE.jpg"},{"id":1117119,"name":"Antonio Canal","character":"Garcés","order":12,"cast_id":1013,"profile_path":"/4G28bAZHzTtfdHfyWVZGqyYM9ZN.jpg"},{"id":1734349,"name":"Teresa González","character":"Cocinera","order":13,"cast_id":1014},{"id":987306,"name":"Rafael Vaquero","character":"Alcalde","order":14,"cast_id":1015},{"id":1629022,"name":"Guillermo Carmona","character":"Guarda","order":15,"cast_id":1021},{"id":2188681,"name":"Cristina Durán","character":"Pilar","order":16,"cast_id":1022},{"id":1611227,"name":"Margarita Aponte","character":"Maruja","order":17,"cast_id":1023},{"id":1742321,"name":"Alicia Sáinz de la Maza","character":"Concha","order":18,"cast_id":1024},{"id":2188683,"name":"Isabel Arce","character":"Luisa","order":19,"cast_id":1025},{"id":2188684,"name":"Felipe Castellanos","character":"Carrasco","order":20,"cast_id":1026},{"id":1241671,"name":"Javier Gómez","character":"Colaso","order":21,"cast_id":1027},{"id":2188686,"name":"Damián Jareño","character":"Julián","order":22,"cast_id":1028}],"crew":[{"id":20693,"name":"Juan Ruiz Anchía","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"id":33804,"name":"Riz Ortolani","department":"Sound","job":"Music","profile_path":"/4ArwVfNnSDehzPCONOIXbmOxrcw.jpg"},{"id":35358,"name":"Félix Murcia","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"id":105226,"name":"Lautaro Murúa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer","profile_path":"/a7teROxSkY9tuisxJmWXZIVMss0.jpg"},{"id":588872,"name":"Antonio José Betancor","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"id":588872,"name":"Antonio José Betancor","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"id":1104525,"name":"Javier Moro","department":"Writing","job":"Writers' Assistant"},{"id":1385620,"name":"Eduardo Biurrun","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"id":1489870,"name":"Javier Artiñano","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"id":1774133,"name":"Ramón J.
