for the Prosecution","overview":"伦敦著名邢案辩护律师韦菲爵士（查尔斯•劳顿 Charles Laughton 饰）接受了心脏病治疗，但是身体依旧虚弱，第一天回家休养，护士一直严厉监督他服药，并杜绝烟酒。管家为了便于上楼，还专门为他修了电梯。但是，种种关心照顾，对于这位桀骜不驯、牙尖嘴利的大律师根本不起作用，反倒是一纸诉状令他倍感兴奋。律师梅休和当事人沃尔（泰隆•鲍华 Tyrone Power饰）登门拜访，请他出山打官司。原来，沃尔结识了富婆，两人相见甚欢，虽然仆人对他发明的打蛋器充满鄙夷，但是富婆却对他充满爱意，甚至为他修改了遗嘱，把8万英镑留给了他。然而，富婆却惨遭毒手。于是，沃尔成为警方的头号嫌疑犯。他的唯一证人是妻子克里斯汀（玛琳•黛德丽 Marlene Dietrich饰），然而后者登门时的冷漠与淡定，令韦菲爵士怀疑这其中另有隐情。在扑朔迷离的案件背后，隐藏着一个个环环相扣、不可告人的秘密……本片改编自阿加莎•克里斯蒂同名小说。　","popularity":10.962,"poster_path":"/bCj4EfuehAlgBwVd3diyWyhuuau.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Edward
