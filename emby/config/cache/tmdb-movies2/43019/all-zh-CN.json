Schuks Tshabalala is a teacher and tour guide to a mixed bag of tourists who are taking his survival guide to SA very seriously. Shorty, as usual, is his best friend, assistant and conscience. The students include ”Heinz” from Germany, “Yoti” from Greece, “Jean-Pierre” from France, “Koert” from The Netherlands, “Rajin” from India, “Maggie” from Ireland and “Xing Xang” from China, among others. They are genuinely eager to learn about SA, so Schuks and Shorty are only too happy to oblige. What follows is a series of hysterical demonstrations of life in SA as they attempt to answer all the questions posed by potential visitors.","popularity":1.236,"poster_path":"/yLgC7xpShCf7QxtFxlYzu6YC8Ms.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2010-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schuks Tshabalala's Survival Guide to South Africa","vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":8,"casts":{"cast":[{"id":80527,"name":"Alfred Ntombela","character":"Alf (Shorty)","order":0,"cast_id":2},{"id":80524,"name":"Leon Schuster","character":"Dr. Schuks Tshabalala / Various","order":2,"cast_id":3},{"id":68501,"name":"Sean Higgs","character":"Heinz","order":3,"cast_id":8},{"id":584526,"name":"Brent Palmer","character":"Zach","order":4,"cast_id":9},{"id":37769,"name":"Tanit Phoenix","character":"Sexy nurse","order":5,"cast_id":10}],"crew":[{"id":80526,"name":"Gray Hofmeyr","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"id":140049,"name":"Johan Lategan","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"id":140052,"name":"Chris Schutte","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"id":937679,"name":"Don Clarke","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"releases":{"countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","certification":"","release_date":"2010-05-28T00:00:00.0000000Z"}]},"images":{"backdrops":[],"posters":[{"file_path":"/yLgC7xpShCf7QxtFxlYzu6YC8Ms.jpg","width":500,"height":750,"aspect_ratio":0.6666666666666666,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"trailers":{"quicktime":[],"youtube":[]}}
