In the first, Karen Nash tries to get her inattentive husband Sam's attention to spruce up their failing marriage. In the second, brash film producer Jesse Kiplinger tries to get his former one-time flame Muriel to see him for what he stands for. In the third, Roy Hubley and his wife Norma try and try to get their uncertain-of-herself daughter out of the bathroom before her approaching wedding.","popularity":3.076,"poster_path":"/yZ5eDobhO60wK4snbX6vtlz0Agh.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Paramount","id":4}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1971-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plaza Suite","vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":20,"casts":{"cast":[{"id":6837,"name":"Walter Matthau","character":"Roy Hubley / Jesse Kiplinger / Sam Nash","order":0,"cast_id":2,"profile_path":"/fLxFSjYwXlNACb4qk7VBsz9ump1.jpg"},{"id":21151,"name":"Maureen Stapleton","character":"Karen Nash","order":1,"cast_id":5,"profile_path":"/rXwg71O6oU6x3sB5c4erlAu7mhy.jpg"},{"id":30618,"name":"Barbara Harris","character":"Muriel Tate","order":2,"cast_id":4,"profile_path":"/lbXPbbbSWb8KZKKU3R84Mss4c2.jpg"},{"id":30123,"name":"Lee Grant","character":"Norma Hubley","order":3,"cast_id":3,"profile_path":"/z8AocSxJCp1m2HKzpwEjtMLsnRG.jpg"},{"id":127260,"name":"Louise Sorel","character":"Miss McCormack","order":4,"cast_id":6},{"id":160136,"name":"Dan Ferrone","character":"bellboy","order":5,"cast_id":9,"profile_path":"/xBcQK9LxITEhCIccXhMiSvdhmFX.jpg"},{"id":2546546,"name":"Jose Ocasio","character":"room service waiter","order":6,"cast_id":12},{"id":2546547,"name":"Thomas Carey","character":"Borden Eisler","order":7,"cast_id":13},{"id":161023,"name":"Jenny Sullivan","character":"Mimsey Hubley","order":8,"cast_id":14},{"id":124382,"name":"Augusta Dabney","character":"Mrs. Eisler","order":9,"cast_id":15},{"id":53584,"name":"Alan North","character":"Mr. Eisler","order":10,"cast_id":16,"profile_path":"/3aMTGX3cy2siUCkxwvHbB9ovC0K.jpg"}],"crew":[{"id":2704,"name":"Maurice Jarre","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer","profile_path":"/44sZGwLqOKdHIkP3Mbz4ArXHT3w.jpg"},{"id":3428,"name":"Howard W.
