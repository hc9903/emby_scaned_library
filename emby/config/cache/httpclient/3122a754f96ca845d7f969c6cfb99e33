The needle in a haystack plot seems to involve our protagonist rescuing his family from some South American drug cartel, or something. At one point Carradine yells those immortal words: \"get the hell out of here\" through closed lips. The villain of the piece never utters a line of dialogue, preferring instead to stalk about in a cape, squinting cannily beneath beret and drooping mustache (with hawk perched on shoulder for added effect). Avoid at all costs, unless you enjoy beating yourself repeatedly over the head with a flail.","popularity":1.564,"poster_path":"/vUlfUWjV3WXzmc8GXjQx9PUenUI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Open Fire","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":3,"casts":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"Joe Rourke","credit_id":"52fe4a51c3a368484e14c86d","gender":2,"id":141,"name":"David Carradine","order":0,"profile_path":"/u6C8DVrC9QgQEovlWLIBob8gvgZ.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Master Ly (as Bruce Ly)","credit_id":"579e386cc3a3683d2b001ac7","gender":0,"id":119438,"name":"Henry Yu Yung","order":1,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Don Gaspar","credit_id":"52fe4a51c3a368484e14c87b","gender":2,"id":38764,"name":"Hugo Stiglitz","order":2,"profile_path":"/8G3HcfAPMkki1YqiaGthLeveTsr.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Morgan","credit_id":"58c63eaa9251411d19013116","gender":0,"id":106478,"name":"Christine Lunde","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Gina Rourke","credit_id":"52fe4a51c3a368484e14c87f","gender":0,"id":1074592,"name":"Kansas Carradine","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Linda","credit_id":"58c63eb4c3a3684128010c28","gender":1,"id":173264,"name":"Wanda Acuna","order":5,"profile_path":"/b9iRUb9nMUfztUJLmXB6oY0uzQ7.jpg"},{"cast_id":9,"character":"1st Lieutenant","credit_id":"58c63ef19251411d3001299a","gender":2,"id":1152416,"name":"Jorge Reynoso","order":6,"profile_path":"/kKYwE7j5nAtPJZ9sY9Z5VY4gTh7.jpg"},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Sheriff Roca","credit_id":"58c63f079251411d300129ae","gender":2,"id":963606,"name":"Julio Aldama Jr.","order":7,"profile_path":"/AmeG2x63XaMBKtnaHj25YmhXGe1.jpg"},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Panther","credit_id":"58c63f199251411d55012cf3","gender":0,"id":104137,"name":"Anaís de Melo","order":8,"profile_path":"/cOOt9eowieQPnpfTRvAh0VhPU9J.jpg"},{"cast_id":12,"character":"Commando","credit_id":"58c63f379251411d11012c79","gender":2,"id":1044093,"name":"Agustín Bernal","order":9,"profile_path":"/j0uBfKiKQSdR9IS7vE4rjPWULfQ.jpg"},{"cast_id":13,"character":"Commando","credit_id":"58c63f459251411d62012b98","gender":0,"id":1700247,"name":"Adalberto Arvizu","order":10,"profile_path":null}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe4a51c3a368484e14c873","department":"Directing","gender":0,"id":1072779,"job":"Director","name":"Roger Mende","profile_path":null}]},"releases":{"countries":[{"certification":"","iso_3166_1":"US","primary":false,"release_date":"1988-01-01"}]},"images":{"backdrops":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.6622807017543859,"file_path":"/vUlfUWjV3WXzmc8GXjQx9PUenUI.jpg","height":912,"iso_639_1":"en","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"width":604}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10175,"name":"drug cartel"}]},"trailers":{"quicktime":[],"youtube":[]}}
