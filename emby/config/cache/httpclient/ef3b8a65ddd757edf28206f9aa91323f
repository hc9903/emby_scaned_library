In the first, Karen Nash tries to get her inattentive husband Sam's attention to spruce up their failing marriage. In the second, brash film producer Jesse Kiplinger tries to get his former one-time flame Muriel to see him for what he stands for. In the third, Roy Hubley and his wife Norma try and try to get their uncertain-of-herself daughter out of the bathroom before her approaching wedding.","popularity":3.076,"poster_path":"/yZ5eDobhO60wK4snbX6vtlz0Agh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/fycMZt242LVjagMByZOLUGbCvv3.png","name":"Paramount","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1971-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Book into Neil Simon's Hotel Suite for the time of your life","title":"Plaza Suite","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":20,"casts":{"cast":[{"cast_id":2,"character":"Roy Hubley / Jesse Kiplinger / Sam Nash","credit_id":"52fe4607c3a36847f80e816f","gender":2,"id":6837,"name":"Walter Matthau","order":0,"profile_path":"/fLxFSjYwXlNACb4qk7VBsz9ump1.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Karen Nash","credit_id":"52fe4607c3a36847f80e817b","gender":1,"id":21151,"name":"Maureen Stapleton","order":1,"profile_path":"/rXwg71O6oU6x3sB5c4erlAu7mhy.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Muriel Tate","credit_id":"52fe4607c3a36847f80e8177","gender":1,"id":30618,"name":"Barbara Harris","order":2,"profile_path":"/lbXPbbbSWb8KZKKU3R84Mss4c2.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Norma Hubley","credit_id":"52fe4607c3a36847f80e8173","gender":1,"id":30123,"name":"Lee Grant","order":3,"profile_path":"/z8AocSxJCp1m2HKzpwEjtMLsnRG.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Miss McCormack","credit_id":"52fe4607c3a36847f80e817f","gender":1,"id":127260,"name":"Louise Sorel","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":9,"character":"bellboy","credit_id":"52fe4607c3a36847f80e818f","gender":2,"id":160136,"name":"Dan Ferrone","order":5,"profile_path":"/xBcQK9LxITEhCIccXhMiSvdhmFX.jpg"},{"cast_id":12,"character":"room service waiter","credit_id":"5e50f975a76ac50013a1c5f7","gender":0,"id":2546546,"name":"Jose Ocasio","order":6,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":13,"character":"Borden Eisler","credit_id":"5e50fa29f48b3400136de0f3","gender":0,"id":2546547,"name":"Thomas Carey","order":7,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":14,"character":"Mimsey Hubley","credit_id":"5e50fae9a93d25001747b56f","gender":1,"id":161023,"name":"Jenny Sullivan","order":8,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":15,"character":"Mrs. Eisler","credit_id":"5e50fb2635811d0015541c55","gender":1,"id":124382,"name":"Augusta Dabney","order":9,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":16,"character":"Mr. Eisler","credit_id":"5e50fb77a76ac50015a18c12","gender":2,"id":53584,"name":"Alan North","order":10,"profile_path":"/3aMTGX3cy2siUCkxwvHbB9ovC0K.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"5e50fe6aa76ac50011a177d4","department":"Sound","gender":2,"id":2704,"job":"Original Music Composer","name":"Maurice Jarre","profile_path":"/44sZGwLqOKdHIkP3Mbz4ArXHT3w.jpg"},{"credit_id":"5e50fbf235811d001954b4da","department":"Production","gender":2,"id":3428,"job":"Producer","name":"Howard W.
