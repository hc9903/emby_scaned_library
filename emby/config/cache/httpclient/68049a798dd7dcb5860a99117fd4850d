The film opens the day before the storm makes landfall--just blocks away from the French Quarter but far from the New Orleans that most tourists knew. Kimberly Rivers Roberts, an aspiring rap artist, is turning her new video camera on herself and her Ninth Ward neighbors trapped in the city. Weaving an insider's view of Katrina with a mix of verit√© and in-your-face filmmaking, it is a redemptive tale of self-described street hustlers who become heroes--two unforgettable people who survive the storm and then seize a chance for a new beginning.","popularity":2.979,"poster_path":"/vbKT5jgX13YaHT8xWARqp45ZlBX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114414,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elsewhere Films","origin_country":""},{"id":8469,"logo_path":null,"name":"Louverture Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's not about a hurricane.
