The war deprived him of his family, and afterwards he endlessly turns over the soil of Antwerp to find the suitcases, which makes him look obsessed. He keeps checking old maps and keeps digging, trying to find, in fact, those he lost. His daughter Chaya is a beautiful modern girl looking for a part-time job. She finds a place as a nanny in the strictly observant Chassidic family with many children, although her secular manners clearly fly in the face of many commandments. One of the reasons she is accepted is that mother of the family is absolutely overburdened by the household, so she stays despite the resistance of the father, normally - an indisputable authority in the family. She develops a special bond with the youngest of the boys, four-year old Simcha, so far incapable of speaking.","popularity":3.172,"poster_path":"/sWprWfhlazwYOjqvQLZXGiRGWjJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7434,"logo_path":null,"name":"Favourite Films NV","origin_country":""},{"id":1259,"logo_path":"/6a5XUQ1c8h8dJragfFs1fpd7SqW.png","name":"Shooting Star Filmcompany BV","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1998-03-30","revenue":100544,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Left Luggage","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":18,"casts":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"Chaya Silberschmidt","credit_id":"52fe4853c3a36847f8161d17","gender":1,"id":42279,"name":"Laura Fraser","order":0,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":2,"character":"Simcha Kalman","credit_id":"52fe4853c3a36847f8161d1b","gender":0,"id":147316,"name":"Adam Monty","order":1,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs. Kalman","credit_id":"52fe4853c3a36847f8161d1f","gender":1,"id":6588,"name":"Isabella Rossellini","order":2,"profile_path":"/cA6Pju1Ply42AQq1aIDzH4NyAJz.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Mr. Kalman","credit_id":"52fe4853c3a36847f8161d23","gender":2,"id":1924,"name":"Jeroen Krabbé","order":3,"profile_path":"/jxZBZGqBDeKFPZ6dLRC8Pc8zynC.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Concierge","credit_id":"52fe4853c3a36847f8161d27","gender":2,"id":11180,"name":"David Bradley","order":4,"profile_path":"/znpkwHitb3pcaJbUmgDqG0YenYp.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Silberschmidt","credit_id":"52fe4853c3a36847f8161d2b","gender":1,"id":32645,"name":"Marianne Sägebrecht","order":5,"profile_path":"/nTsZ2QAbtxzDVy18QvwXMuQgM4Y.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Mr. Silberschmidt","credit_id":"52fe4853c3a36847f8161d2f","gender":2,"id":12150,"name":"Maximilian Schell","order":6,"profile_path":"/eoLFawdXpv7RIlh5Sm4d73ZxBXE.jpg"},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Yacov Apfelschnitt","credit_id":"52fe4854c3a36847f8161d33","gender":2,"id":10501,"name":"Chaim Topol","order":7,"profile_path":"/5fjx2eSiQPJYTWOcnwb7QPZ3IUB.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe4854c3a36847f8161d39","department":"Directing","gender":2,"id":1924,"job":"Director","name":"Jeroen Krabbé","profile_path":"/jxZBZGqBDeKFPZ6dLRC8Pc8zynC.jpg"},{"credit_id":"5a7091290e0a26796f0137be","department":"Writing","gender":2,"id":16670,"job":"Writer","name":"Edwin de Vries","profile_path":"/vFedZozykBpVJntVhSU4HYqA055.jpg"},{"credit_id":"550ba6d29251414699002b25","department":"Editing","gender":0,"id":51697,"job":"Editor","name":"Edgar Burcksen","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"5a7091230e0a26796f0137b0","department":"Writing","gender":0,"id":1969576,"job":"Novel","name":"Carl Friedman","profile_path":null}]},"releases":{"countries":[{"certification":"","iso_3166_1":"NL","primary":false,"release_date":"1998-03-30"}]},"images":{"backdrops":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.6666666666666666,"file_path":"/sWprWfhlazwYOjqvQLZXGiRGWjJ.jpg","height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2315,"name":"jewish life"},{"id":2606,"name":"jew / jewish"},{"id":10183,"name":"independent film"},{"id":10939,"name":"holocaust survivor"}]},"trailers":{"quicktime":[],"youtube":[]}}
