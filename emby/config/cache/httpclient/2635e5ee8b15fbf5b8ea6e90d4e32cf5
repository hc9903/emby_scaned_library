Posing as the prostitute's long-lost brother \"Antonio Cerruti,\" he discovers a mare's nest of police corruption. In fact, in this comedy thriller the whole town is corrupt. If they were closely examined, Stan's methods for pursuing this investigation might embarrass the police. For instance, he drives into a criminal's house in a fancy, expensive race car. In another incident, he callously blows up a casino owned by Musard , one of the town's crime bosses. On that occasion, he first forces Musard to remove his clothes, and the poor criminal watches his casino explode from across the square while standing naked in a phone booth. Meanwhile, Stan seduces the lovely Edmonde.","popularity":6.884,"poster_path":"/bXGSFer2I5EUnlb7pbQxLftSQmc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1979-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cop or Hood","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":76,"casts":{"cast":[{"cast_id":5,"character":"Antonio Cerutti / Stanislas Borovitz","credit_id":"52fe4590c3a36847f80ce49f","gender":2,"id":3829,"name":"Jean-Paul Belmondo","order":0,"profile_path":"/1XNXClPazdrXenfwTnWkBEBqhBD.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Theodore Musard","credit_id":"52fe4590c3a36847f80ce4a3","gender":2,"id":19632,"name":"Georges Géret","order":1,"profile_path":"/b8cIQk0sxwnF4snfMuG1S8lnH7V.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Inspecteur Massard","credit_id":"52fe4590c3a36847f80ce4a7","gender":2,"id":35527,"name":"Jean-François Balmer","order":2,"profile_path":"/5CLhlqqDJMjTx8t9ZkAyNwRBzQR.jpg"},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Achille Volfoni","credit_id":"52fe4590c3a36847f80ce4ab","gender":2,"id":25076,"name":"Claude Brosset","order":3,"profile_path":"/u2TEqxC1TwE7WdxYIXkrYTZi9Tf.jpg"},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Charlotte","credit_id":"5616d4279251412af200016e","gender":1,"id":262075,"name":"Julie Jézéquel","order":4,"profile_path":"/gT8xNBN2xhP2JqN44qklXqUshHK.jpg"},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Grimaud","credit_id":"5616d47a9251412ae300018a","gender":2,"id":24629,"name":"Michel Galabru","order":5,"profile_path":"/f6uvYIfc6cgQkn713rViFXIUCn0.jpg"},{"cast_id":12,"character":"Edmonde Puget-Rostand","credit_id":"5dbfc26bf1b5710010e800ed","gender":1,"id":39644,"name":"Marie Laforêt","order":6,"profile_path":"/vn6ZiZWC9O7FjHbiEbfFSXFC0G1.jpg"},{"cast_id":13,"character":"Le chef de transmission","credit_id":"5e91007f3679a10018371e89","gender":2,"id":23480,"name":"Henri Attal","order":7,"profile_path":"/cQTa563ohAzzA1Nej7OvB1Qmuz1.jpg"},{"cast_id":14,"character":"Marcel Langlois","credit_id":"5e9100b7befb09001abc164c","gender":2,"id":18560,"name":"Michel Beaune","order":8,"profile_path":"/f3e1ACJvzz1fxrZkzOkeJ6ebU19.jpg"},{"cast_id":15,"character":"Simone Langlois","credit_id":"5e9100db37b3a900158a91f9","gender":1,"id":35887,"name":"Catherine Lachens","order":9,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":16,"character":"Mario","credit_id":"5e9100fabefb09001abc1667","gender":2,"id":22312,"name":"Venantino Venantini","order":10,"profile_path":"/pWBt1ipKBrry5YOSTasOZaLf44f.jpg"},{"cast_id":17,"character":"Cazauban","credit_id":"5e91011b15376c001afcf1b5","gender":2,"id":55920,"name":"Charles Gérard","order":11,"profile_path":"/f7ImmSsUKajeS1BVtEMCYJXHmlR.jpg"},{"cast_id":18,"character":"L'inspecteur du permis de conduire","credit_id":"5e91013e4a4bf60fa251b273","gender":2,"id":278368,"name":"Philippe Castelli","order":12,"profile_path":"/wibBdQJ8ILvQ5aR1MhxNMbqXpxr.jpg"},{"cast_id":19,"character":"L'inspecteur Rey","credit_id":"5e9101bd8ec4ab0016f0b743","gender":2,"id":37745,"name":"Tony Kendall","order":13,"profile_path":"/t28IGryL4XAXDq6z2n9FhaghbBz.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe4590c3a36847f80ce49b","department":"Directing","gender":2,"id":18563,"job":"Director","name":"Georges Lautner","profile_path":"/9eX5ACCAv7nroWLValxB5qxgUt7.jpg"},{"credit_id":"52fe4590c3a36847f80ce4b1","department":"Writing","gender":2,"id":49856,"job":"Writer","name":"Michel Grisolia","profile_path":null}]},"releases":{"countries":[{"certification":"","iso_3166_1":"FR","primary":false,"release_date":"1979-03-28"},{"certification":"","iso_3166_1":"US","primary":false,"release_date":"1979-04-04"},{"certification":"16","iso_3166_1":"DE","primary":false,"release_date":"1979-06-21"}]},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777777777777778,"file_path":"/v4IYpvcpfs34FShpJ2h0YkS4ol6.jpg","height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"vote_average":5.312,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"trailers":{"quicktime":[],"youtube":[]}}
