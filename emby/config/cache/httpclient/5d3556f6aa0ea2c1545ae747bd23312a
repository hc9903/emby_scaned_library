Tuba (Hung) is a fainthearted cop who prefers to play in the brass section of the police band to pounding the streets.  One day, he finds himself caught up in an extortion case with trigger-happy detective Rambo Chow (David Chiang Da-wei). When Rambo gets fatally wounded, he makes a half-hearted vow to avenge his death.  Tuba is more than a little surprised when Rambo's spirit returns to make sure the timid cop makes good on his promise.  Backed up by his hotshot partner Cheung (Jacky Cheung Hok-yau), Tuba eventually summons the gumption to track down the baddies.","popularity":2.332,"poster_path":"/jwE4t5kxs69TDhnOO1hjhSmxB0O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1986-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where's Officer Tuba?","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"casts":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"Officer Tuba","credit_id":"52fe4b12c3a36847f81f0c75","gender":2,"id":62410,"name":"Sammo Hung","order":0,"profile_path":"/obcVnz46IRb2im6hLkG1vftqzIV.jpg"},{"cast_id":2,"character":"Cheung","credit_id":"52fe4b12c3a36847f81f0c79","gender":2,"id":25245,"name":"Jacky Cheung","order":1,"profile_path":"/2qv5bkTi1X3IeiADV8o2UO6o3Zi.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Joanne","credit_id":"52fe4b12c3a36847f81f0c81","gender":1,"id":68557,"name":"Joey Wong","order":2,"profile_path":"/czi7jy9VnrEmrJTE9oVUJRgDsY.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Sergeant Rambo Chow","credit_id":"52fe4b12c3a36847f81f0c7d","gender":2,"id":65986,"name":"David Chiang","order":3,"profile_path":"/8Px2kQf2KTCeSfch6RJaljEPgc.jpg"},{"cast_id":15,"character":"Chung","credit_id":"55d5a75192514102c8003ebf","gender":2,"id":544916,"name":"Paul Chang Chung","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Police band drummer","credit_id":"52fe4b12c3a36847f81f0c85","gender":2,"id":62419,"name":"Stanley Fung","order":5,"profile_path":"/oURJiuRSTcykch6KGHCxd2qNOkS.jpg"},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Sau","credit_id":"52fe4b12c3a36847f81f0c91","gender":2,"id":567303,"name":"Wu Fung","order":6,"profile_path":"/A9Nm7gvUsaXSYXbKsqQ8F4csc0O.jpg"},{"cast_id":9,"character":"Joanne's father","credit_id":"52fe4b12c3a36847f81f0c95","gender":2,"id":571521,"name":"Teddy Yip Wing-Cho","order":7,"profile_path":"/tfJWAnUqq312lO64fEP7jVP8MPl.jpg"},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Extortion gang member","credit_id":"52fe4b12c3a36847f81f0c9d","gender":2,"id":57609,"name":"Yuen Wah","order":9,"profile_path":"/yMkMgs0tWlJXdTjYkiMcjvhYnRw.jpg"},{"cast_id":12,"character":"Taoist priest in deity Chun Kui costume","credit_id":"52fe4b12c3a36847f81f0ca1","gender":2,"id":35452,"name":"Corey Yuen","order":10,"profile_path":"/9y23Y7euINslLeoz2jbu2pQvkQj.jpg"},{"cast_id":16,"character":"Police band trumpet player","credit_id":"56cbefe29251412467001483","gender":0,"id":87733,"name":"Paul Chun","order":11,"profile_path":"/gwbj1SEpFI8O0QwBD2Jlh5dx2y0.jpg"},{"cast_id":17,"character":"Drug addict","credit_id":"56cbf00792514124610014e1","gender":2,"id":1174365,"name":"Tai Bo","order":12,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":18,"character":"Rambo's superior officer","credit_id":"56cbf01292514124610014e4","gender":2,"id":26786,"name":"Melvin Wong","order":13,"profile_path":"/5CTqgCnXDbWFV7pXvqTKcWLAvKU.jpg"},{"cast_id":19,"character":"Taoist priest [cameo]","credit_id":"56cbf01f925141245e0014fd","gender":2,"id":62423,"name":"Lam Ching-Ying","order":14,"profile_path":"/8gS55Yvd4XR9ntBGQiDN3vma712.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"56cbf05ec3a36865e90014b1","department":"Directing","gender":2,"id":70591,"job":"Director","name":"Philip Chan Yan-Kin","profile_path":"/iR0GJTUOP7M7W4GKi52LWsXmZHD.jpg"},{"credit_id":"5871b4449251413561010568","department":"Writing","gender":2,"id":70591,"job":"Writer","name":"Philip Chan Yan-Kin","profile_path":"/iR0GJTUOP7M7W4GKi52LWsXmZHD.jpg"},{"credit_id":"52fe4b12c3a36847f81f0ca7","department":"Directing","gender":0,"id":932916,"job":"Director","name":"Ricky Lau","profile_path":"/vkc4f0sVRzvQ0Z9X9CMBT8hyFE7.jpg"}]},"releases":{"countries":[{"certification":"","iso_3166_1":"HK","primary":false,"release_date":"1986-03-20"}]},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777777777777778,"file_path":"/mCT6YvGgpK2YTKEu0kZvq5mkWUY.jpg","height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.6666666666666666,"file_path":"/jwE4t5kxs69TDhnOO1hjhSmxB0O.jpg","height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"trailers":{"quicktime":[],"youtube":[]}}
