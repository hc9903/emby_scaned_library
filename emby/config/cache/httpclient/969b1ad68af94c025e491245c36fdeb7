In a time when the barriers of sexual morality and social convention have been broken down, Kay, Helen, Viv and Duncan enjoy a freedom never experienced before.  Moving back in time through the 1940s into the maelstrom of the Blitz, the lives, loves and losses of these four central characters are unravelled. For them, the post-war victory is bittersweet, for it returns them to the margins of society, from which they hoped they had been liberated. In order to build their future they must each make peace with their past.","popularity":5.511,"poster_path":"/7ayMrUTmt9FIqIOLrLZrlpWBFDX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/16fY7pucCzn7WSOYxOGRHlAayL3.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Love and liberation in wartime","title":"The Night Watch","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":13,"casts":{"cast":[{"cast_id":10,"character":"Kay Langrish","credit_id":"5429c42bc3a3682d650005b5","gender":1,"id":29236,"name":"Anna Maxwell Martin","order":0,"profile_path":"/vBAsZPe1tHPvVLViiDWYkb5k1Cu.jpg"},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Helen Giniver","credit_id":"5429c4410e0a260a21000597","gender":1,"id":120932,"name":"Claire Foy","order":1,"profile_path":"/i8M7bLEJ2OF0P7GplTIEq46pA2J.jpg"},{"cast_id":12,"character":"Vivian Pearce","credit_id":"5429c454c3a3682d730005c2","gender":1,"id":66431,"name":"Jodie Whittaker","order":2,"profile_path":"/3M4wgunSct5Lt2kNq29Vlvdz1aG.jpg"},{"cast_id":13,"character":"Julia Standing","credit_id":"5429c4690e0a260a300005a0","gender":1,"id":145632,"name":"Anna Wilson-Jones","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":14,"character":"Duncan Pearce","credit_id":"5429c4810e0a260a270005e2","gender":2,"id":45051,"name":"Harry Treadaway","order":4,"profile_path":"/miinW3n8c2hZW9uy5FBfxO86f2H.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Nancy Carmichael","credit_id":"52fe47f0c3a368484e0e1665","gender":1,"id":36663,"name":"Claudie Blakley","order":7,"profile_path":"/bUy1X1ili9Goj3AQNrBD1kd7A8q.jpg"},{"cast_id":17,"character":"Horace Mundy","credit_id":"5429c4c8c3a3682d730005d5","gender":2,"id":26258,"name":"Kenneth Cranham","order":8,"profile_path":"/9lzTbNgaoArlxpEkYtWQfOyiYwu.jpg"},{"cast_id":2,"character":"Iris Knight","credit_id":"52fe47f0c3a368484e0e165d","gender":0,"id":565176,"name":"Jenna Augen","order":9,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Mr. Bryant","credit_id":"52fe47f0c3a368484e0e1661","gender":0,"id":195609,"name":"Neal Barry","order":10,"profile_path":"/7HLA5uHIQvPpDTSpx91TtOiAqAL.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Policeman","credit_id":"52fe47f0c3a368484e0e1675","gender":0,"id":100738,"name":"Richard Cambridge","order":11,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Jack Brown","credit_id":"52fe47f0c3a368484e0e1679","gender":2,"id":1029653,"name":"Tom Weston-Jones","order":12,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":18,"character":"Reggie Nigri","credit_id":"54961412c3a3686ae9004fdb","gender":0,"id":165441,"name":"Liam Garrigan","order":13,"profile_path":"/5OXbMru5VPSlYDX4d4JIpfpnP2H.jpg"},{"cast_id":19,"character":"Robert Fraser","credit_id":"5625f3cdc3a3680e16013188","gender":2,"id":30710,"name":"J.J.
