Described as “Greek, Moresque, and Celtic with a dash of the Egyptian, the Persian, and the Japanese,” the room provided a fitting setting for one of the most eclectic and culturally curious artists in music today.  Amos performed a career-spanning set featuring classics from her debut Little Earthquakes through to Abnormally Attracted to Sin.  A candid interview with Tori is also included.  Tori Amos is one of the most influential and respected artists of the modern era.  The double-digit Grammy nominee has recorded 11 acclaimed studio albums (and gone platinum nearly 20 times) since emerging in the early ’90s.  She released two new CDs in 2009:Abnormally Attracted to Sin and her first seasonal project, Midwinter Graces.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bWuFsA8uwPtnGmvsF852W211zT1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tori Amos: Live from The Artists Den","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"casts":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"Vocals, Piano","credit_id":"52fe48dd9251416c750b5cc3","gender":1,"id":111164,"name":"Tori Amos","order":0,"profile_path":null}],"crew":[]},"releases":{"countries":[{"certification":"","iso_3166_1":"US","primary":false,"release_date":"2010-07-18"}]},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777777777777778,"file_path":"/rhnmLChce4Idd8e326dkkT5HYoW.jpg","height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.6873333333333334,"file_path":"/bWuFsA8uwPtnGmvsF852W211zT1.jpg","height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"width":1031}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"trailers":{"quicktime":[],"youtube":[]}}
