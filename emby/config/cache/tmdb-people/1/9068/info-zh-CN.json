{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Raymond Wallace Bulcao"],"biography":"Ray Bolger began his career in vaudeville. He was half of a team called \"Sanford and Bolger\" and also did numerous Broadway shows on his own. He, like Gene Kelly, was a song-and-dance man as well as an actor. He was signed to a contract with MGM in 1936 and his first role was as himself in The Great Ziegfeld (1936). This was soon followed by a role opposite Eleanor Powell in Rosalie (1937). His first dancing and singing role was in Sweethearts (1938), where he did the \"wooden shoes\" number with red-headed soprano/actress Jeanette MacDonald. This got him noticed by MGM producers and resulted in his being cast in his most famous role, that of the Scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz (1939). Surprisingly, even though the film was a success, Bolger's contract with MGM ended. He went to RKO to make Four Jacks and a Jill (1942). After this, Bolger went to Broadway, where he received his greatest satisfaction. In 1953 he turned to television and got his own sitcom, Where's Raymond? (1953), later changed to \"The Ray Bolger Show\". After his series ended, Bolger made frequent guest appearances on TV and had some small roles in movies. In 1985 he co-hosted That's Dancing! (1985) with Liza Minnelli. Bolger died in 1987 at the age of 83. Interred at Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City, California, USA, in the Mausoleum, Crypt F2, Block 35.","birthday":"1904-01-10","deathday":"1987-01-15","id":9068,"imdb_id":"nm0001961","name":"Ray Bolger","place_of_birth":"Boston, Massachusetts, U.S","popularity":1.151,"profile_path":"/43GZ1i6m905Q0r0qe99lgUUPX5O.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":111611,"title":"Where's Charley?","character":"Charley Wykeham","original_title":"Where's Charley?","poster_path":"/4szbfuNOR31b8oYrjlfFJoAeTAe.jpg","release_date":"1952-06-26","adult":false},{"id":248492,"title":"Four Jacks and a Jill","character":"Nifty Sullivan, a Jack","original_title":"Four Jacks and a Jill","release_date":"1942-01-23","adult":false},{"id":32611,"title":"Babes in Toyland","character":"Barnaby","original_title":"Babes in Toyland","poster_path":"/wyZhrj5LUOVSWQClSUrKxsOWBKX.jpg","release_date":"1961-12-14","adult":false},{"id":40693,"title":"April in Paris","character":"Sam Winthrop Putnam","original_title":"April in Paris","poster_path":"/sErEVDh7OtUhzZlM4AdQaU6jvxL.jpg","release_date":"1952-12-24","adult":false},{"id":42047,"title":"That's Dancing!","character":"Himself - Host","original_title":"That's Dancing!","poster_path":"/mAQZhdP6HIXq6JKYZtgEo2rU2bZ.jpg","release_date":"1985-01-01","adult":false},{"id":94615,"title":"Look for the Silver Lining","character":"Jack Donahue","original_title":"Look for the Silver Lining","release_date":"1949-07-30","adult":false},{"id":117250,"title":"Sunny","character":"Bunny Billings","original_title":"Sunny","poster_path":"/rSrOMF6zb2J4u7V5y2sHwUg4r97.jpg","release_date":"1941-05-30","adult":false},{"id":630,"title":"绿野仙踪","character":"Hunk / Scarecrow","original_title":"The Wizard of Oz","poster_path":"/mkFyFkF5KXVcb8Hf8Dj0KZuew2u.jpg","release_date":"1939-08-15","adult":false},{"id":28907,"title":"The Harvey Girls","character":"Chris Maule","original_title":"The Harvey Girls","poster_path":"/6QPlrXVsOyRncPXdePPbjDqyi4N.jpg","release_date":"1946-01-18","adult":false},{"id":266100,"title":"The Entertainer","character":"Billy Rice","original_title":"The Entertainer","release_date":"1976-03-10","adult":false},{"id":254393,"title":"Another Romance of Celluloid: Electrical Power","character":"Himself (uncredited)","original_title":"Another Romance of Celluloid: Electrical Power","poster_path":"/y3Y9vx1XcGLho4CsDRCGJbmO8Ms.jpg","release_date":"1938-12-31","adult":false},{"id":334629,"title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic","character":"Self (archive footage)","original_title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic","poster_path":"/sRbxxXrhcUYeDoT4DAxF8mMCjTF.jpg","release_date":"1990-02-20","adult":false},{"id":26328,"title":"Just You and Me, Kid","character":"Tom","original_title":"Just You and Me, Kid","poster_path":"/4nx99aeCDJGlT5T3myL8ta1pEjE.jpg","release_date":"1979-07-13","adult":false},{"id":43849,"title":"Sweethearts","character":"Hans","original_title":"Sweethearts","poster_path":"/4Xt5UsD9x3lx1F7G5iU6uAuPNZK.jpg","release_date":"1938-12-30","adult":false},{"id":151839,"title":"The Runner Stumbles","character":"Monsignor Nicholson","original_title":"The Runner Stumbles","release_date":"1979-11-16","adult":false},{"id":603525,"title":"To Oz!
