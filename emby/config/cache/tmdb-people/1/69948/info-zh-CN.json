{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"William Bowers (Las Cruces, 1916 - Woodland Hills, California, 1987) was a reporter in Long Beach, California before becoming a screenwriter and specializing in writing comedy westerns and also turned out several thrillers. His first credited screenplay was My Favorite Spy in 1942.\n\nHis career noticeably picked up after his Oscar nomination for the gritty Gregory Peck Western The Gunfighter in 1950, leading to such assignments as the remake of My Man Godfrey in 1957 and The Sheepman in 1958 (a second Oscar nomination).\n\nBowers produced the last film that he wrote, the superior Western parody Support Your Local Sheriff! (1969). He also had a bit part as an actor in The Godfather Part II (1974).","birthday":"1916-01-17","deathday":"1987-03-27","id":69948,"imdb_id":"nm0101115","name":"William Bowers","place_of_birth":"Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA","popularity":0.609,"credits":{"cast":[{"id":240,"title":"教父2","character":"Senate Committee Chairman","original_title":"The Godfather: Part II","poster_path":"/amvmeQWheahG3StKwIE1f7jRnkZ.jpg","release_date":"1974-12-20","adult":false}],"crew":[{"id":32849,"title":"Abandoned","original_title":"Abandoned","department":"Crew","job":"Additional Dialogue","poster_path":"/beshwW735ZMu5uI4EeGxFK20tmC.jpg","release_date":"1949-10-28","adult":false},{"id":11574,"title":"侠盗双雄","original_title":"Support Your Local Sheriff","department":"Production","job":"Producer","poster_path":"/8ZPPTX6JnnLhYp5eYEw1cnEZPNC.jpg","release_date":"1969-03-26","adult":false},{"id":11574,"title":"侠盗双雄","original_title":"Support Your Local Sheriff","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay","poster_path":"/8ZPPTX6JnnLhYp5eYEw1cnEZPNC.jpg","release_date":"1969-03-26","adult":false},{"id":25549,"title":"Split Second","original_title":"Split Second","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay","poster_path":"/nzW2X7qIittssjOKnOqXdwvbFf9.jpg","release_date":"1953-05-02","adult":false},{"id":25689,"title":"Larceny","original_title":"Larceny","department":"Writing","job":"Writer","poster_path":"/8aBwgvoWkHEgsKyJkI1AltcPzs0.jpg","release_date":"1948-09-03","adult":false},{"id":25726,"title":"Cry Danger","original_title":"Cry Danger","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay","poster_path":"/uDLed2y0kazsVwL6HSxrt88RAPK.jpg","release_date":"1951-02-23","adult":false},{"id":25728,"title":"The Mob","original_title":"The Mob","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay","poster_path":"/jYtR39ZZ17LIFrR8al4vQr59i6n.jpg","release_date":"1951-09-07","adult":false},{"id":35920,"title":"Convicted","original_title":"Convicted","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay","poster_path":"/5ejTogTtUXHJasV0Bmr78CYxn5B.jpg","release_date":"1950-08-01","adult":false},{"id":35924,"title":"-30-","original_title":"-30-","department":"Writing","job":"Writer","poster_path":"/y8BmGrOF3Nxp0wrJeHco9cgTjc2.jpg","release_date":"1959-11-11","adult":false},{"id":29113,"title":"The Web","original_title":"The Web","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay","poster_path":"/wboVVsbVMvH9GFSPnted2Rh1A8a.jpg","release_date":"1947-05-25","adult":false},{"id":43485,"title":"Night and Day","original_title":"Night and Day","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay","poster_path":"/mrlKsBUxPwxGr8M8xupI96qrA8j.jpg","release_date":"1946-07-02","adult":false},{"id":61648,"title":"Something in the Wind","original_title":"Something in the Wind","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay","release_date":"1947-07-21","adult":false},{"id":37911,"title":"5 Against the House","original_title":"5 Against the House","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay","poster_path":"/kEzrpJL6eCB9e4a46mBnAMH53cb.jpg","release_date":"1955-06-10","adult":false},{"id":44766,"title":"The Law and Jake Wade","original_title":"The Law and Jake Wade","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay","poster_path":"/dKUT6UDardg67QbaFqUVIWF1gqK.jpg","release_date":"1958-06-06","adult":false},{"id":39318,"title":"Alias Jesse James","original_title":"Alias Jesse James","department":"Writing","job":"Writer","poster_path":"/9401kHeTLSsAMmwcrph7VkJP35x.jpg","release_date":"1959-03-20","adult":false},{"id":17409,"title":"枪手","original_title":"The Gunfighter","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay","poster_path":"/tM881N4sUevhKhV5K7XeGBf2U79.jpg","release_date":"1950-06-23","adult":false},{"id":17409,"title":"枪手","original_title":"The Gunfighter","department":"Writing","job":"Story","poster_path":"/tM881N4sUevhKhV5K7XeGBf2U79.jpg","release_date":"1950-06-23","adult":false},{"id":52470,"title":"My Man Godfrey","original_title":"My Man Godfrey","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay","poster_path":"/1USQaKWKbnZsk2cgWzaQdc2Bu6T.jpg","release_date":"1957-10-11","adult":false},{"id":73902,"title":"Ride to Hangman's Tree","original_title":"Ride to Hangman's Tree","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay","release_date":"1967-04-23","adult":false},{"id":76121,"title":"Tight Spot","original_title":"Tight Spot","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay","poster_path":"/rrbittYkvEUFjfPp1apg1EMZJ8E.jpg","release_date":"1955-03-19","adult":false},{"id":87294,"title":"Assignment: Paris","original_title":"Assignment: Paris","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay","poster_path":"/5N3wG9U42ChaurEjuwMQvNAc7ks.jpg","release_date":"1952-09-04","adult":false},{"id":102195,"title":"Way...
