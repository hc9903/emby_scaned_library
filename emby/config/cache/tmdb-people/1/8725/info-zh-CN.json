She appeared in 49 feature films, and was one of the leading movie stars during the golden age of Classical Hollywood. She is best known for her early screen performances in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) and Gone with the Wind (1939), and her later award-winning performances in To Each His Own (1946), The Snake Pit (1948), and The Heiress (1949).\n\nBorn in Tokyo to British parents, de Havilland and her younger sister, actress Joan Fontaine, moved with their mother to California in 1919. They were brought up by their mother Lilian, a former stage actress who taught them drama, music, and elocution. Olivia de Havilland made her screen debut in Reinhardt's A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1935. During her career, she often played demure ingénues opposite popular leading men, including Errol Flynn, with whom she made nine films. They became one of Hollywood's most popular romantic on-screen pairings. She achieved her initial popularity in romantic comedy films, such as The Great Garrick (1937), and in Westerns, such as Dodge City (1939). Her natural beauty and refined acting style made her particularly effective in historical period dramas, such as Anthony Adverse (1936), and romantic dramas, such as Hold Back the Dawn (1941). In her later career, she was most successful in dramas, such as Light in the Piazza (1962), and unglamorous roles in psychological dramas including Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964).\n\nIn addition to her film career, de Havilland continued her work in the theatre, appearing three times on Broadway. She also worked in television, appearing in the successful miniseries, Roots: The Next Generations (1979), and television feature films, such as Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna, for which she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. During her film career, de Havilland won two Academy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, two New York Film Critics Circle Awards, the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress, and the Venice Film Festival Volpi Cup. For her contributions to the motion picture industry, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. For her lifetime contribution to the arts, she received the National Medal of Arts from President George W. Bush, and was appointed a Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur by French President Nicolas Sarkozy.\n\nDe Havilland and Joan Fontaine are the only siblings to have won Academy Awards in a lead acting category. A lifelong rivalry between the two actresses resulted in an estrangement that lasted over three decades. De Havilland has lived in Paris since 1956, and celebrated her 100th birthday on July 1, 2016. In June 2017, two weeks before her 101st birthday, de Havilland was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to drama. She is the oldest woman ever to receive the honour. In a statement, she called it \"the most gratifying of birthday presents\".","birthday":"1916-07-01","id":8725,"imdb_id":"nm0000014","name":"Olivia de Havilland","place_of_birth":"Tokyo, Japan","popularity":2.575,"profile_path":"/4xAiJRetjwvHUsS9rjH3iW4RdKH.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":33039,"title":"Princess O'Rourke","character":"Princess Maria","original_title":"Princess O'Rourke","poster_path":"/m6ipzLDLcP3jWJlYMApJ9IUq1Je.jpg","release_date":"1943-10-23","adult":false},{"id":28571,"title":"女继承人","character":"Catherine Sloper","original_title":"The Heiress","poster_path":"/j5lp02XWQzT2UsxWdshEOSwrL1R.jpg","release_date":"1949-10-06","adult":false},{"id":42787,"title":"Lady in a Cage","character":"Mrs. Cornelia Hilyard","original_title":"Lady in a Cage","poster_path":"/u3nnsgUBbveRozOl43JzHm1GZBC.jpg","release_date":"1964-01-01","adult":false},{"id":44041,"title":"阴阳镜","character":"Terry / Ruth Collins","original_title":"The Dark Mirror","poster_path":"/ulfhQ4Pd7ltzMo6v0plAI36jSli.jpg","release_date":"1946-10-17","adult":false},{"id":45247,"title":"吾家有女初长成","character":"Meg Johnson","original_title":"Light in the Piazza","poster_path":"/vNlaQd8MJRqIhk8a93PHJW619Db.jpg","release_date":"1962-02-07","adult":false},{"id":73430,"title":"Government Girl","character":"Elizabeth 'Smokey' Allard","original_title":"Government Girl","poster_path":"/1o3TUBeHtmPTKVWFlftlt8NJR6C.jpg","release_date":"1943-11-05","adult":false},{"id":54568,"title":"To Each His Own","character":"Miss Josephine 'Jody' Norris","original_title":"To Each His Own","poster_path":"/hK6X6MzQMileA5Ps2gga9OXnUr6.jpg","release_date":"1946-03-12","adult":false},{"id":76117,"title":"Not as a Stranger","character":"Kristina Hedvigson","original_title":"Not as a Stranger","poster_path":"/iSwjB1gHlnnaoo1HpwcGSctSLYY.jpg","release_date":"1955-07-01","adult":false},{"id":94529,"title":"My Cousin Rachel","character":"Rachel Sangalletti Ashley","original_title":"My Cousin Rachel","poster_path":"/77NYu9eJogyRpXOMRO7xGKQqEAQ.jpg","release_date":"1952-12-25","adult":false},{"id":101889,"title":"The Ambassador's Daughter","character":"Joan Fisk","original_title":"The Ambassador's Daughter","release_date":"1956-07-26","adult":false},{"id":134800,"title":"The Screaming Woman","character":"Laura Wynant","original_title":"The Screaming Woman","poster_path":"/8wkcFdG1mZZA2olsXPRsdQtx8hn.jpg","release_date":"1972-01-29","adult":false},{"id":138121,"title":"That Lady","character":"Ana de Mendoza","original_title":"That Lady","poster_path":"/btiZ9sSLPT6NGL4yN4FxbRkVwbZ.jpg","release_date":"1955-05-11","adult":false},{"id":190084,"title":"Call It a Day","character":"Catherine 'Cath' Hilton","original_title":"Call It a Day","release_date":"1937-04-17","adult":false},{"id":232625,"title":"My Love Came Back","character":"Amelia Cornell","original_title":"My Love Came Back","poster_path":"/mRbYYTxU4mfDhYRZm9ebnAn4rr6.jpg","release_date":"1940-07-13","adult":false},{"id":62694,"title":"蛇穴","character":"Virginia Stuart Cunningham","original_title":"The Snake Pit","poster_path":"/7NkGhyPfLoPHiFzXVUXU91nMeLb.jpg","release_date":"1948-11-04","adult":false},{"id":1718,"title":"Santa Fe Trail","character":"Kit Carson Holliday","original_title":"Santa Fe Trail","poster_path":"/xpDrAjAb78alXCNnvrxONeCh92E.jpg","release_date":"1940-12-20","adult":false},{"id":10299,"title":"最毒妇人心","character":"Miriam Deering","original_title":"Hush...
