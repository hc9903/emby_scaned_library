She began her career during the silent film era and\n\noften appeared in comedy shorts opposite Roscoe Arbuckle.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York, Lake began her career as a\n\ndancer.[1] She made her screen debut in 1912, and she appeared in a number of\n\ncomedy shorts by Mack Sennett. Lake was often the leading lady of Roscoe\n\nArbuckle in comedies like Oh Doctor! (1917) and The Cook (1918). Arbuckle\n\ndirected both films and was joined by Buster Keaton who had a leading role in\n\nOh Doctor.\n\nLake also played dramatic roles with Bert Lytell in\n\nBlackie's Redemption and The Lion's Den, both from 1919. During the 1920s she\n\nappeared in a number of Metro silent film features as the lead actress. At the\n\nheight of her career she earned $1,200 per week as a motion picture actress.\n\nLake had only limited success in dramatic roles. Following the introduction of\n\ntalkies, her parts in films began to wane and she only performed in supporting\n\nroles. Her last appearance in film was in 1935 with a bit part in Frisco Kid.\n\nIn all her screen credits numbered ninety-six.\n\nIn March 1924, Lake married fellow actor Robert Williams,\n\nbut they were divorced in 1925. The couple separated and reunited three times\n\nbefore they made a permanent break. Williams was a vaudeville performer who had\n\nappeared in a number of stage plays. He was previously married to singer Marion\n\nHarris.\n\nLake died of a heart attack at Paradise Sanitarium in\n\nHollywood, California. She was 71. She is buried at Valhalla Memorial Park\n\nCemetery in North Hollywood.\n\nFor her contribution to the motion picture industry, Alice\n\nLake has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1620 Vine
