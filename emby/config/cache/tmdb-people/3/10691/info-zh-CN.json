{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"April Grace is a SAG Award nominated American actress.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Grace landed a recurring role as the transporter chief on Star Trek: The Next Generation. Interspersing acclaimed and award-winning stage work in Los Angeles with her film and TV roles, the actress slowly rose from bit parts in major studio films to more prominent characters in independent films. In 2001, she was seen as a TV reporter determined to become a household name in ABC's summer series The Beast, set in the world of a 24-hour cable news station.\n\nWhile she had numerous stage and small screen credits, Grace was still a relatively fresh face when writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson tapped her to play a determined television reporter in his 1999 drama Magnolia. She shared most of her scenes with Tom Cruise, who played a foul-mouthed sex guru, and the subject of her interview.\n\nGrace has also appeared on the television series Lost as the character Ms. Klugh. In 2007, Grace appeared as a news reporter in the film I Am Legend.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article April Grace, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","birthday":"1962-05-12","id":10691,"imdb_id":"nm0333318","name":"April Grace","place_of_birth":"Lakeland - Florida - USA","popularity":1.16,"profile_path":"/nV8nnymN0ClT3xppwhlAtUnjSxa.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":65736,"title":"Waterproof","character":"","original_title":"Waterproof","release_date":"2000-01-01","adult":false},{"id":363684,"title":"Shelter","character":"Ruth","original_title":"Shelter","poster_path":"/b5Z6cEOWoI69EFduxkDNbXJMgiL.jpg","release_date":"2015-06-01","adult":false},{"id":325165,"title":"Midnight Son","character":"Virginia Hall","original_title":"Midnight Son","poster_path":"/oKzRzlyHmN1Yf5HCRCsLjYDyMvw.jpg","release_date":"2007-02-02","adult":false},{"id":711,"title":"心灵访客","character":"Ms. Joyce","original_title":"Finding Forrester","poster_path":"/heHi6n68fDiQoUc7SMletM9Adjz.jpg","release_date":"2000-12-21","adult":false},{"id":96357,"title":"Headless Body in Topless Bar","character":"Letitia Jackson","original_title":"Headless Body in Topless Bar","release_date":"1995-05-20","adult":false},{"id":637512,"title":"Slip Away","character":"Paula","original_title":"Slip Away","poster_path":"/eSQgSmGE6b2HyLRbKX9HnoLDShW.jpg","release_date":"2011-04-30","adult":false},{"id":10005,"title":"深入敌后2：邪恶轴心","character":"Ellie Brilliard","original_title":"Behind Enemy Lines II: Axis of Evil","poster_path":"/7sbLeFbRxSNXHc1ZO4zxFy3sIgc.jpg","release_date":"2006-10-17","adult":false},{"id":57316,"title":"Voice from the Grave","character":"Jennie","original_title":"Voice from the Grave","poster_path":"/kkmUcCJTUxpzQgdxFDuZQP8lD0p.jpg","release_date":"1996-03-20","adult":false},{"id":32646,"title":"安然无恙","character":"Susan","original_title":"Safe","poster_path":"/3Rgjajh3biiK5ABKkGoqfy54bMs.jpg","release_date":"1995-06-23","adult":false},{"id":539651,"title":"别放手","character":"Sergeant Julia Rodriguez","original_title":"Don't Let Go","poster_path":"/uNHueGo5TYCTLzoGULse65GC32Q.jpg","release_date":"2019-08-30","adult":false},{"id":842,"title":"The Assassination of Richard Nixon","character":"Mae Simmons","original_title":"The Assassination of Richard Nixon","poster_path":"/5jOOvAVvP0XtwC5yYQpQCy4cjq1.jpg","release_date":"2004-05-17","adult":false},{"id":825,"title":"随心所欲","character":"Valery","original_title":"Playing by Heart","poster_path":"/uGYcD5DzpmWM11PR44q32FTzD7m.jpg","release_date":"1998-12-30","adult":false},{"id":83714,"title":"Angie","character":"","original_title":"Angie","poster_path":"/A7B8snyynp1iOBYiGx76V3TOdKq.jpg","release_date":"1994-03-04","adult":false},{"id":561,"title":"康斯坦丁","character":"Dr. Leslie Archer","original_title":"Constantine","poster_path":"/shzGvspK2PCS9XRxY67VjUnMDC0.jpg","release_date":"2005-02-08","adult":false},{"id":574950,"title":"Miss Virginia","character":"Mrs. Jackson","original_title":"Miss Virginia","poster_path":"/1rZ396S5YqgdC9k7MWYnpiDyCb3.jpg","release_date":"2019-10-18","adult":false},{"id":334,"title":"木兰花","character":"Gwenovier","original_title":"Magnolia","poster_path":"/uq2u8HgtLFJkjNq2kHb2jvipIPT.jpg","release_date":"1999-12-10","adult":false},{"id":6479,"title":"我是传奇","character":"TV Personality","original_title":"I Am Legend","poster_path":"/rlQ2c0OMeFuXwMC6FEitT7hhucI.jpg","release_date":"2007-12-14","adult":false},{"id":644,"title":"人工智能","character":"Female Colleague","original_title":"A.I.
