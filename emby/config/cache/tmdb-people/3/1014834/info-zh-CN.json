{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Lyman Wakefield Perrin","Jack Gable","Richard Terry"],"biography":"From Wikipedia\n\nJack Perrin (July 25, 1896 – December 17, 1967) was an American actor specializing in Westerns.\n\nHe was born Lyman Wakefield Perrin in Three Rivers, Michigan; his father worked in real estate and relocated the family to Los Angeles, California shortly after the start of the 20th century.\n\nPerrin served in the United States Navy during World War I.\n\nFollowing the war, he returned to Los Angeles and started acting for Universal Studios. His first on-screen appearance was in the 1917 film Luke's Lost Liberty alongside Harold Lloyd.\n\nHe married silent film actress Josephine Hill in 1920.\n\nDuring the 1920s, Perrin made a name for himself, starring in a number of cliffhanger, melodrama, and serial films.\n\nPerrin found a niche in B-movie Westerns of the 1930s. He usually played leads as Jack Perrin, but occasionally adopted the pseudonyms Jack Gable or Richard (Dick) Terry.\n\nPerrin's last major role was as Davy Crockett in 1937's The Painted Stallion, for Republic Pictures. Perrin divorced his wife that year as well. Though he continued making films through 1960, many of his later roles were minor and often went uncredited.\n\nPerrin suffered a heart attack and died December 17, 1967, aged 71.\n\nFor his contributions as an actor in motion pictures, Jack Perrin was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1777 Vine Street, in Hollywood, California.","birthday":"1896-07-25","deathday":"1967-12-17","id":1014834,"imdb_id":"nm0674741","name":"Jack Perrin","place_of_birth":"Three Rivers, Michigan, USA","popularity":0.6,"credits":{"cast":[{"id":129956,"title":"The Apache Kid's Escape","character":"Jim aka The Apache Kid","original_title":"The Apache Kid's Escape","poster_path":"/lZw2PRaoYynnmMJWIr3iRPlHytP.jpg","release_date":"1930-11-22","adult":false},{"id":192553,"title":"Loser's End","character":"Jack","original_title":"Loser's End","release_date":"1935-01-24","adult":false},{"id":202843,"title":"Hair-Trigger Casey","character":"Captain Jim Hair-Trigger Casey","original_title":"Hair-Trigger Casey","release_date":"1936-03-01","adult":false},{"id":202965,"title":"Gun Grit","character":"Bob Blake","original_title":"Gun Grit","release_date":"1936-05-27","adult":false},{"id":251808,"title":"Jaws of Justice","character":"Sergeant Kinkaid","original_title":"Jaws of Justice","poster_path":"/pXy6iuBvMtGsF04XlEqSwD20idq.jpg","release_date":"1933-12-04","adult":false},{"id":254696,"title":"North of Arizona","character":"Jack Loomis","original_title":"North of Arizona","poster_path":"/xKGNsgOh7nvt0fc1bYdktxvXOoP.jpg","release_date":"1935-02-02","adult":false},{"id":254699,"title":"The Cactus Kid","character":"Jack Durant","original_title":"The Cactus Kid","release_date":"1935-01-04","adult":false},{"id":189547,"title":"Midnight Faces","character":"Richard Mason","original_title":"Midnight Faces","release_date":"1926-03-24","adult":false},{"id":233440,"title":"Pink Tights","character":"Rev.
