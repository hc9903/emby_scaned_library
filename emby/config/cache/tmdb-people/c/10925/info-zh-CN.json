{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Torin Herbert Erskine Thatcher","Lt. Torin Thatcher R.A.","T. Atkinson"],"biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nTorin Thatcher (15 January 1905 - 4 March 1981) was an English actor born in Bombay, British India, India), to English parents. He was an imposing, powerfully built figure noted for his flashy portrayals of screen villains.\n\nHe was educated in England at Bedford School and at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. He worked as a schoolmaster before first appearing on the London stage in 1927 and then entering British films in 1934. He appeared in the 1937 Old Vic stage production of Hamlet, in which Laurence Olivier made his first appearance in the title role, opposite Vivien Leigh as Ophelia. During the Second World War, he served with the Royal Artillery and was demobilized with the rank of lieutenant colonel.\n\nThatcher appeared in classic British films of the late 1930s and 1940s, including Major Barbara (1941) and Great Expectations (1946), in which he played Bentley Drummle. He moved to Hollywood in the 1950s. He was constantly in demand, invariably lending his looming figure and baleful countenance to sinister or stern roles in popular costume thrillers such as The Crimson Pirate (1952), Blackbeard the Pirate (1952), The Robe (1953) (as the disapproving father of Richard Burton's character), The Black Shield of Falworth (1954), Helen of Troy (1956), Darby's Rangers (1958), and The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958). He also appeared in the Marlon Brando and Trevor Howard 1962 remake of Mutiny on the Bounty.\n\nHe returned to the stage quite frequently, notably on Broadway, in such esteemed productions as Edward, My Son (1948), That Lady (1949) and Billy Budd (1951). In 1959, he portrayed Captain Keller in the award-winning play The Miracle Worker with Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke. All of these plays were filmed, but Thatcher did not appear in the movie versions.\n\nAlso a steady fixture on television, he appeared in such made-for-TV films as adaptations of A. J. Cronin's Beyond This Place (1957) and The Citadel (1960),Bonanza(1961), and Brenda Starr (1976). He also played the title role in a Philco Television Playhouse version of Othello and acted in a CBS production of Beyond This Place (1957).\n\nThatcher died of cancer on March 4, 1981, in Thousand Oaks, California, in the Los Angeles area.","birthday":"1905-01-15","deathday":"1981-03-04","id":10925,"imdb_id":"nm0857147","name":"Torin Thatcher","place_of_birth":"Bombay, British India, India","popularity":1.388,"profile_path":"/d5PZBimAcJjP239mVx98a2Ifv1o.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":435400,"title":"The Common Round","character":"Martin","original_title":"The Common Round","release_date":"1936-03-12","adult":false},{"id":25360,"title":"Jack the Giant Killer","character":"Pendragon","original_title":"Jack the Giant Killer","poster_path":"/fNx33noBPrLH8q0gxRaUoKRg6Cb.jpg","release_date":"1962-05-17","adult":false},{"id":43192,"title":"Houdini","character":"Otto","original_title":"Houdini","poster_path":"/xC9jSDIrVwjTjLMHmTsPUZZrTph.jpg","release_date":"1953-07-02","adult":false},{"id":15515,"title":"辛巴达七航妖岛","character":"Sokurah the Magician","original_title":"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad","poster_path":"/mzEFF9YRN13HLz6Cq7jMYR8aHVb.jpg","release_date":"1958-12-05","adult":false},{"id":53879,"title":"爱情多么美好","character":"Humphrey Palmer-Jones","original_title":"Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing","poster_path":"/a9aqlitzVeo5fq6UX5Ekl5kopco.jpg","release_date":"1955-08-18","adult":false},{"id":55859,"title":"吉人天相","character":"Godfrey Langston","original_title":"Knock On Wood","poster_path":"/wxRAvtgvQTg8fCX1Gm4aDvIYbIL.jpg","release_date":"1954-04-06","adult":false},{"id":217267,"title":"Hell of Borneo","character":"Mr. Bellflower","original_title":"Hell of Borneo","release_date":"1967-12-10","adult":false},{"id":255083,"title":"The Canadians","character":"Superintendent Walker","original_title":"The Canadians","poster_path":"/7B94zar3GQ9UqJ37k4W3mU3QSea.jpg","release_date":"1961-03-11","adult":false},{"id":11570,"title":"The Crimson Pirate","character":"Humble Bellows","original_title":"The Crimson Pirate","poster_path":"/lOSqs9ntb2wB7gveCx2l7cqC1nG.jpg","release_date":"1952-08-27","adult":false},{"id":203562,"title":"Istanbul","character":"Douglas Fielding","original_title":"Istanbul","poster_path":"/eDEQdkaDQPjGPrhmmPnhObUkB49.jpg","release_date":"1957-05-22","adult":false},{"id":210674,"title":"Bengal Brigade","character":"Colonel Morrow","original_title":"Bengal Brigade","poster_path":"/lLJshKeOeXFrGU3RF6hasz9oaer.jpg","release_date":"1954-11-06","adult":false},{"id":370158,"title":"Old Mother Riley, MP","character":"Jack Nelson","original_title":"Old Mother Riley, MP","release_date":"1939-08-15","adult":false},{"id":3024,"title":"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde","character":"Sir Turnbull","original_title":"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde","poster_path":"/xlVyTmUJbsyxdpjyLySUoLPm9rv.jpg","release_date":"1968-01-07","adult":false},{"id":61430,"title":"Affair in Trinidad","character":"Inspector Smythe","original_title":"Affair in Trinidad","poster_path":"/vvP6PLgUu7A82Gn52hcMjezlsza.jpg","release_date":"1952-07-29","adult":false},{"id":120509,"title":"Blackbeard, the Pirate","character":"Sir Henry Morgan","original_title":"Blackbeard, the Pirate","poster_path":"/2puF7JXLl21I8cguY3ix70b6oQP.jpg","release_date":"1952-12-24","adult":false},{"id":113939,"title":"Lady Godiva of Coventry","character":"Lord Godwin","original_title":"Lady Godiva of Coventry","poster_path":"/4vFH1bSHj3M7RLaOG3Z1S2oM1aR.jpg","release_date":"1955-11-02","adult":false},{"id":278800,"title":"Drums of Africa","character":"Jack Cuortemayn","original_title":"Drums of Africa","release_date":"1963-05-15","adult":false},{"id":4460,"title":"乞力马扎罗的雪","character":"Johnson","original_title":"The Snows of Kilimanjaro","poster_path":"/wF15fNcolOPGvzEkkRlVNdix98T.jpg","release_date":"1952-08-18","adult":false},{"id":24442,"title":"黑盾武士","character":"Sir James","original_title":"The Black Shield Of Falworth","poster_path":"/8gXIl5Ql8VGv5Hmm3LM5y5d1AD0.jpg","release_date":"1954-09-02","adult":false},{"id":46615,"title":"Darby's Rangers","character":"Sergeant McTavish","original_title":"Darby's Rangers","poster_path":"/pIT512QJRcaCuAAFLMMw9RM0cxW.jpg","release_date":"1958-02-12","adult":false},{"id":177046,"title":"Diane","character":"Louis - Count de Breze","original_title":"Diane","poster_path":"/7uGzyCqIEROz2NLBHsTshrXxGOh.jpg","release_date":"1956-01-12","adult":false},{"id":36554,"title":"The Desert Rats","character":"Col Barney White","original_title":"The Desert Rats","poster_path":"/7gEa0CaaW6GuutN0CZwK9lpgp4M.jpg","release_date":"1953-05-20","adult":false},{"id":37311,"title":"Band of Angels","character":"Capt.
