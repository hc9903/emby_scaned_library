{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Alex Hyde White"],"biography":"​From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nAlex Punch Hyde-White (born 30 January 1959) is an English born, US raised film and television actor. He is sometimes credited as Alex Hyde White. Known as Punch to friends, he grew up in Palm Springs, CA attending PSHS (Class of 1975) and Georgetown University in Washington DC for one year after which he left to pursue the inevitable acting career. In 1978 he signed with Universal Pictures as one of the last \"contract players\" in Hollywood, in a group that included Lindsay Wagner, Andrew Stevens and Sharon Gless. One of the youngest under contract, at age 18, his first TV job was one line \"leave my mother alone\" spoken to star Jack Klugman on the iconic TV series \"Quincy M.E.\" He recurred in several episodes, each time a different character and also made numerous appearances in \"Battlestar:Galactica\" with Lorne Greene and later \"Buck Rogers in the 25th Century\" which also featured his father Wilfrid. The only time both father and son appeared on screen together was on the Merv Griffin show in 1980. Hyde-White was born in London, the son of Ethel M. (née Korenman), a stage manager who acted under the name Ethel Drew, and the actor Wilfrid Hyde-White. Hyde-White was married to actress Karen Dotrice, daughter of actor Roy Dotrice from 1986 until 1992. Through his production company TMG, named after mentor, Washington attorney Steven Martindale, he produced the 2002 independent romantic drama, Pursuit of Happiness which starred Frank Whaley, Annabeth Gish, Adam Baldwin and featured the great American comedienne Jean Stapleton in a cameo as the advertising agency's owner. Her son John Putch was the director. Putch directed Alex prior in \"Deep Water\" and since in \"Murder:101\" starring another great American comedian Dick Van Dyke for Hallmark. Alex has worked with Steven Spielberg three times, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, as Young Henry Jones, Sr., Catch Me If You Can and The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn, due for release in 2011. Film heroes growing up included actors Steve McQueen, Spencer Tracy, William Holden (whom Alex knew quite well through family friend Stefanie Powers) and Actor/Filmmakers Warren Beatty and Clint Eastwood. Alex has directed TMG's next production, due for release in Winter/Spring 2011, the hybrid docu-drama \"Three Days (www.threedaysofhamlet.com) and is developing the existentialist crime drama \"King of Infinite Space\" with the books author Tyler Dilts, as an independent film. He is represented by Ann Geddes and Richard Lewis at the Geddes Agency and by well-known Hollywood attorney Michael Donaldson. He is married to Shelly Hyde-White and resides in Santa Monica, California. He has two children, Garrick and Jack.
