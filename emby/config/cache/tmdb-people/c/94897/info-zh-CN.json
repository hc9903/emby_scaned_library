{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"Dan White (March 25, 1908 - July 7, 1980) was born to George & Orpha White about one mile from the  Suwannee River in Falmouth, Florida. Falmouth was a small sleepy town  then, as it is still today. He was one of 12 siblings who were moved to  Lakeland sometime around WW I. Lakeland is where Dan was introduced into  show business in 1922 at the age of 14. He ran away from home when the  show moved on and traveled thousands of miles throughout the South in  tent, minstrel, vaudeville and theater shows. Dan performed on stage  with his brother Willard for nine years with a stock company in Tampa's  old Rialto Theater. Frances Langford  worked with him during this time and it was Dan who told her to go to  Hollywood. During this period he met Matilda \"Tilda\" Mae Spivey on the  stage, and married her on February 25, 1933. Tilda had a two-year-old  child from a previous marriage by the name of Arthur \"Art\" Grant  Gifford. Times were tough, so Dan had to get out of show business for a  while to make some real money. In 1934 he found work with the  Conservation Corps in Homestead, Florida, but show business was always  in his heart. Dan knew he had what it took to \"make it\" in Hollywood, so  he decided to make the move to California in 1935. They packed all  their possessions into their Ford and started the long, arduous trek  across the country. This was during the Great Depression, and money was  very tight. They had to stop frequently in various cities across the  country to make extra money to continue their journey. Dan was a very  good auto mechanic and never had a problem finding this type of work  wherever he went. This skill paid off once during the filming of To Kill a Mockingbird  (1962). During the \"mob\" scene, one of the cars they were to drive away  in would not start. Dan opened the hood, stepped onto the front bumper,  and had the car running in no time flat.\n\nDate of Birth  25 March  1908, Falmouth, Florida\n\nDate of Death  7 July  1980, Tampa, Florida","birthday":"1908-03-25","deathday":"1980-07-07","id":94897,"imdb_id":"nm0924643","name":"Dan White","place_of_birth":"Falmouth, Florida, USA","popularity":0.656,"profile_path":"/3BP5nARiDh89MRya4tjeAGyMEMO.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":393305,"title":"Outlaw Country","character":"Jim McCord","original_title":"Outlaw Country","poster_path":"/lzNEPd00JoJWUfHvo9qMr7MBbna.jpg","release_date":"1949-01-07","adult":false},{"id":77055,"title":"Sunset Carson Rides Again","character":"Sheriff Norton","original_title":"Sunset Carson Rides Again","poster_path":"/unjE8IfhKM1DHnUPkQ8wbBtfvy5.jpg","release_date":"1948-09-10","adult":false},{"id":337769,"title":"Beyond the Bermuda Triangle","character":"Caldas","original_title":"Beyond the Bermuda Triangle","poster_path":"/ywkziDlYWFDcrIlqbOcQUk0ZCX.jpg","release_date":"1975-11-06","adult":false},{"id":136837,"title":"Unknown Island","character":"Crewman Edwards","original_title":"Unknown Island","poster_path":"/whMYBMFVX7GdL08n9C9jxBWZIdc.jpg","release_date":"1948-10-15","adult":false},{"id":22718,"title":"Attack of the Giant Leeches","character":"Porky Reed (as Daniel White)","original_title":"Attack of the Giant Leeches","poster_path":"/tTuK2rBQBe8QqYcW533TYuOsyeT.jpg","release_date":"1959-10-01","adult":false},{"id":133286,"title":"Harmony Trail","character":"Henchman Bronco","original_title":"Harmony Trail","poster_path":"/gwJg14oNzOlML0KZWXrZ648UhOY.jpg","release_date":"1944-12-01","adult":false},{"id":170493,"title":"Arizona Whirlwind","character":"Engineer Jim Lockwood","original_title":"Arizona Whirlwind","release_date":"1944-02-21","adult":false},{"id":64139,"title":"Four Faces West","character":"Clint Waters","original_title":"Four Faces West","poster_path":"/8KchGHE95B1R6PUVWLsMV2lLqOM.jpg","release_date":"1948-08-03","adult":false},{"id":187534,"title":"The First Traveling Saleslady","character":"Sheriff","original_title":"The First Traveling Saleslady","poster_path":"/5JPX4mwhwhrcMhAeo9jKMxCLWWm.jpg","release_date":"1956-08-01","adult":false},{"id":336726,"title":"The Utah Kid","character":"Henchman Slim","original_title":"The Utah Kid","release_date":"1944-08-25","adult":false},{"id":146768,"title":"The Americano","character":"Barney Dent","original_title":"The Americano","poster_path":"/zOubti5UzAck9UudRQkm97sH71T.jpg","release_date":"1955-01-19","adult":false},{"id":325103,"title":"Escape from Red Rock","character":"Al Farris (as Daniel White)","original_title":"Escape from Red Rock","release_date":"1957-12-01","adult":false},{"id":285948,"title":"Westward Bound","character":"Henchman Wade","original_title":"Westward Bound","release_date":"1944-01-17","adult":false},{"id":37615,"title":"Cover Up","character":"Gabe","original_title":"Cover Up","poster_path":"/l7jVest5c2UEitcBNofBAV2gSRm.jpg","release_date":"1949-02-25","adult":false},{"id":442542,"title":"Arizona Trail","character":"Sheriff Jones","original_title":"Arizona Trail","release_date":"1943-09-15","adult":false},{"id":452426,"title":"Gun Town","character":"Joe - Henchman","original_title":"Gun Town","poster_path":"/yui4bhRdr7LuHFzEz0wYRGUBNWa.jpg","release_date":"1946-01-18","adult":false},{"id":455802,"title":"Gunning for Justice","character":"Sheriff","original_title":"Gunning for Justice","poster_path":"/dyweOOpc9qqE27YjR261EMC0rnK.jpg","release_date":"1948-11-06","adult":false},{"id":206384,"title":"Gunfire at Indian Gap","character":"Fred Moran","original_title":"Gunfire at Indian Gap","poster_path":"/yKLYB2czrHCj71pjnCKQMcuIgil.jpg","release_date":"1957-12-11","adult":false},{"id":131898,"title":"This Earth Is Mine","character":"Judge Gruber","original_title":"This Earth Is Mine","poster_path":"/AdXwmw5QK9jxpj5sIwXArjVmCVC.jpg","release_date":"1959-06-26","adult":false},{"id":698734,"title":"Smoke In The Wind","character":"Col.
