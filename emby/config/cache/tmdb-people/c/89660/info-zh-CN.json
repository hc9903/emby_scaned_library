{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nEmerson Treacy (September 17, 1900 – January 10, 1967) was a film, Broadway, and radio actor.\n\nTreacy was teamed with comedienne Gay Seabrook to form the double-act Treacy and Seabrook. The team was very successful on radio and in theater during the early 1930s, with routines similar to those of real husband-and-wife team Burns and Allen.\n\nModern audiences will remember Treacy as the flustered father of Spanky McFarland in the Our Gang short films Bedtime Worries and Wild Poses.\n\nTreacy played in dozens of other feature films, including small roles in Adam's Rib and The Wrong Man, as well as television programs such as The Lone Ranger, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and Perry Mason.\n\nTreacy died after undergoing surgery on January 10, 1967.","birthday":"1900-09-07","deathday":"1967-01-10","id":89660,"imdb_id":"nm0871551","name":"Emerson Treacy","place_of_birth":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA ","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/qkKT1vbSgddHCv4pCBjH6JJlo5.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":193506,"title":"Dream Stuff","character":"Clarence","original_title":"Dream Stuff","release_date":"1933-05-11","adult":false},{"id":159001,"title":"Over the Counter","character":"Frederick (Freddie) Drake","original_title":"Over the Counter","release_date":"1932-10-15","adult":false},{"id":575302,"title":"Atomic Energy as a Force for Good","character":"Dr. Petersen","original_title":"Atomic Energy as a Force for Good","poster_path":"/9m6NWKsCyb9POQNIlgsQZPqFjFi.jpg","release_date":"1955-01-01","adult":false},{"id":161979,"title":"Bedtime Worries","character":"Emerson Treacy","original_title":"Bedtime Worries","poster_path":"/nnQYs2ItQqn8bWDnr9gNFc9X3Ab.jpg","release_date":"1933-09-08","adult":false},{"id":22985,"title":"徘徊者","character":"William Gilvray","original_title":"The Prowler","poster_path":"/siB8RiyBTc9gtQFKpdkMjdz7LLA.jpg","release_date":"1951-05-25","adult":false},{"id":227296,"title":"Mutiny","character":"Council Speaker","original_title":"Mutiny","poster_path":"/hAwi5Z1agQlkCa69ueXKXJGT67X.jpg","release_date":"1952-03-05","adult":false},{"id":127037,"title":"Wild Poses","character":"Emerson Treacy (Spanky's Dad)","original_title":"Wild Poses","release_date":"1933-10-28","adult":false},{"id":72474,"title":"Fort Worth","character":"Ben Garvin","original_title":"Fort Worth","poster_path":"/mAaCd888Uiudpe9Gtp7m3a3290s.jpg","release_date":"1951-07-14","adult":false},{"id":25431,"title":"亚当的肋骨","character":"Jules Fr-ikke","original_title":"Adam's Rib","poster_path":"/vRxbZQvyaIKRWQMR53Ylfm6JXgU.jpg","release_date":"1949-11-18","adult":false},{"id":261564,"title":"Two Alone","character":"Milt Pollard","original_title":"Two Alone","poster_path":"/qcan0Gg0s6lIbHBkFdhWXtvOKUR.jpg","release_date":"1934-01-26","adult":false},{"id":337452,"title":"Eight Bells","character":"Sparks","original_title":"Eight Bells","release_date":"1935-04-10","adult":false},{"id":334902,"title":"The Long Shot","character":"Henry Knox","original_title":"The Long Shot","release_date":"1939-01-06","adult":false},{"id":118936,"title":"Stand-In","character":"Tommy","original_title":"Stand-In","poster_path":"/kElHrXgDNhZ9MSeiJqaeaQ9NZMB.jpg","release_date":"1937-10-29","adult":false},{"id":230098,"title":"Honeymoon Limited","character":"Bridegroom","original_title":"Honeymoon Limited","release_date":"1935-07-01","adult":false},{"id":249381,"title":"The Grand Bounce","character":"Jimmy Clark (uncredited)","original_title":"The Grand Bounce","poster_path":"/iIhmAwpsrbp9AC1ohiIQzS5NMGh.jpg","release_date":"1937-05-22","adult":false},{"id":159615,"title":"喧哗与骚动","character":"Selby","original_title":"The Sound and the Fury","poster_path":"/6enr19elLi4cuV1Ed5AgvdJVgpu.jpg","release_date":"1959-03-27","adult":false},{"id":114875,"title":"The Dark at the Top of the Stairs","character":"George, the banker","original_title":"The Dark at the Top of the Stairs","poster_path":"/vL1JetnF7yT3zjsGTAK7vdsWC5A.jpg","release_date":"1960-09-28","adult":false},{"id":120112,"title":"Wyoming Mail","character":"Ben","original_title":"Wyoming Mail","poster_path":"/5txCWji3rCBesHyQAKp56YlPqPo.jpg","release_date":"1950-10-10","adult":false},{"id":143838,"title":"The Mouthpiece","character":"Robert Wilson","original_title":"The Mouthpiece","poster_path":"/lmVjrQjMxJE2SQpxJozrYOXUOFC.jpg","release_date":"1932-05-07","adult":false},{"id":52437,"title":"Invitation to Happiness","character":"Photographer (uncredited)","original_title":"Invitation to Happiness","poster_path":"/eVnKA29mQE7eYguDarqSUcIDrER.jpg","release_date":"1939-06-07","adult":false},{"id":235679,"title":"Dr. Socrates","character":"Young Man","original_title":"Dr. Socrates","poster_path":"/sn8wrzUkKnrwRF2ZXzMpxJRFTsJ.jpg","release_date":"1935-10-19","adult":false},{"id":770,"title":"乱世佳人","character":"Minor Role (uncredited)","original_title":"Gone with the Wind","poster_path":"/ziFqKCCGGa4zGXqZhkPShECxt8P.jpg","release_date":"1939-12-15","adult":false}],"crew":[]},"images":{"profiles":[{"file_path":"/qkKT1vbSgddHCv4pCBjH6JJlo5.jpg","width":390,"height":585,"aspect_ratio":0.66666666666667,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"nm0871551","tvrage_id":0}}
