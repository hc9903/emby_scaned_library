{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"Alex Ziwak has been featured in commercials, films and television, acting in shows like \"Blue Bloods\", \"Gotham\", \"Person of Interest\",\"Law and Order\", and in several full length feature films. He is an accomplished martial artist, who began his formal training in the art of Tae Kwon Do at the age of 10. Because of his  prominent cheek bones, pale complexion, and dark hair he often plays villains, but his versatility as an actor has afforded him roles outside that genre. He was also a lead singer in a local band in Connecticut.","homepage":"http://www.alexziwak.com/","id":1454322,"imdb_id":"nm2900021","name":"Alex Ziwak","place_of_birth":"New Haven, Connecticut, USA","popularity":0.6,"credits":{"cast":[{"id":442064,"title":"骄傲的玛丽","character":"Ukrainian Gangster","original_title":"Proud Mary","poster_path":"/5luceoVMU2FzWuyty7mZFcSY5ZW.jpg","release_date":"2018-01-12","adult":false},{"id":395791,"title":"Secret Lives of Husbands and Wives","character":"Eastern European Henchman","original_title":"Secret Lives of Husbands and Wives","release_date":"2013-01-01","adult":false},{"id":419472,"title":"波尔卡舞王","character":"Prison Inmate","original_title":"The Polka King","poster_path":"/dU1XG1DI6lkZ567vmtM9ifQJ38F.jpg","release_date":"2017-01-22","adult":false},{"id":324552,"title":"疾速特攻","character":"Russian Gunman (uncredited)","original_title":"John Wick: Chapter 2","poster_path":"/c1BJwdAhEVWPPDyuoLzkYKH3Gf5.jpg","release_date":"2017-02-08","adult":false},{"id":49026,"title":"蝙蝠侠：黑暗骑士崛起","character":"Thug (uncredited)","original_title":"The Dark Knight Rises","poster_path":"/85cWkCVftiVs0BVey6pxX8uNmLt.jpg","release_date":"2012-07-16","adult":false}],"crew":[]},"images":{"profiles":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"nm2900021","tvrage_id":0}}
