{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Tom Towles (March 20, 1950 – April 2, 2015) was an American actor.\n\nTowles was born and raised in Chicago. He became an actor after a stint in the U.S. Marines, beginning with an uncredited performance in Dog Day Afternoon (1975). He has appeared in film and television extensively since the 1980s. He is probably best known for his turn in Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer as a character modeled after Ottis Toole, Henry Lee Lucas' reputed accomplice in several murders. He has also appeared in Night of the Living Dead, The Rock, Blood in Blood Out, House of 1000 Corpses, and its sequel, The Devil's Rejects. Recently Tom also portrayed a vicious drug trafficking Aryan gang leader in the big screen adaptation of Miami Vice (he played a similar role as Aryan prison gang leader Red Rider in Blood In Blood Out) and had a cameo in one of the faux trailers Werewolf Women of the SS in Robert Rodriguez's Grindhouse. His television credits include appearances in NYPD Blue, L.A. Law, ER, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (in the episode \"Dramatis Personae\"), Star Trek Voyager, and Firefly.\n\nTowles died on April 2, 2015, at the age of 65, in a hospital in Pinellas, Florida of complications following a stroke.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Tom Towles, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.  ","birthday":"1950-03-20","deathday":"2015-04-02","id":27736,"imdb_id":"nm0869981","name":"Tom Towles","place_of_birth":"Chicago, Illinois, U.S.","popularity":1.578,"credits":{"cast":[{"id":28111,"title":"Home Sick","character":"Uncle Johnny","original_title":"Home Sick","poster_path":"/5RM68eZxDzHC0Evojyq7YSS4Ifc.jpg","release_date":"2007-06-14","adult":false},{"id":420139,"title":"Night of the Lawyers","character":"Alien","original_title":"Night of the Lawyers","adult":false},{"id":10692,"title":"杀手的肖像","character":"Otis","original_title":"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer","poster_path":"/7eiBnV1i1WDwfNDzCsZVexAswMb.jpg","release_date":"1986-09-24","adult":false},{"id":40221,"title":"The Borrower","character":"Bob Laney","original_title":"The Borrower","poster_path":"/h9dvb82gcM3EriHb50MXYnygFfe.jpg","release_date":"1989-01-01","adult":false},{"id":19185,"title":"活死人之夜","character":"Harry Cooper","original_title":"Night of the Living Dead","poster_path":"/isp4lCv08asTPNvv8Xe8oQK293n.jpg","release_date":"1990-10-18","adult":false},{"id":75454,"title":"The Visitor","character":"Dietz","original_title":"The Visitor","poster_path":"/9vM6SwZKydHhG91rxrwErHtGhpK.jpg","release_date":"2002-09-21","adult":false},{"id":227002,"title":"Michael Lives: The Making of 'Halloween'","character":"Himself","original_title":"Michael Lives: The Making of 'Halloween'","release_date":"2008-10-07","adult":false},{"id":10433,"title":"疯狗与格拉瑞小姐","character":"Andrew the Beater","original_title":"Mad Dog and Glory","poster_path":"/5S7gELZXG1BUHyAAHw9E77zBN0J.jpg","release_date":"1993-03-05","adult":false},{"id":12088,"title":"魔鬼武器","character":"Stiggs","original_title":"Fortress","poster_path":"/evjpqWPUY4VpOdyLpeRfkGU8DiR.jpg","release_date":"1992-09-30","adult":false},{"id":9702,"title":"Bound by Honor","character":"Red Ryder","original_title":"Bound by Honor","poster_path":"/gvP6R6juhe2IpCG7QGDgjyUvm0g.jpg","release_date":"1993-02-05","adult":false},{"id":33156,"title":"Blood on the Highway","character":"Louis Debois","original_title":"Blood on the Highway","release_date":"2008-01-01","adult":false},{"id":2662,"title":"千尸屋","character":"Lieutenant George Wydell","original_title":"House of 1000 Corpses","poster_path":"/vvwcILsa0arryQlORuYk5GcUKF5.jpg","release_date":"2003-04-11","adult":false},{"id":47090,"title":"The Pit and the Pendulum","character":"Don Carlos","original_title":"The Pit and the Pendulum","poster_path":"/xq4pLMaMlVmDEzaxTrDqDa4ET25.jpg","release_date":"1991-06-27","adult":false},{"id":23223,"title":"Normal Life","character":"Frank Anderson","original_title":"Normal Life","poster_path":"/bThB9FnxufmcJUTDzkANV9316cQ.jpg","release_date":"1996-01-26","adult":false},{"id":41872,"title":"Girls in Prison","character":"Norman Stoneface","original_title":"Girls in Prison","poster_path":"/42gZLRZStmVH3shTSTj3iDZ9RBf.jpg","release_date":"1994-08-19","adult":false},{"id":49478,"title":"Warriors of Virtue","character":"Grillo","original_title":"Warriors of Virtue","poster_path":"/8fT8cttGyXx36P24W0tum2QxsLf.jpg","release_date":"1997-05-02","adult":false},{"id":2082,"title":"新万圣节","character":"Larry Redgrave","original_title":"Halloween","poster_path":"/kX0tl6NyfLw1N2vegNEVO0SNZAg.jpg","release_date":"2007-08-31","adult":false},{"id":1696,"title":"千尸屋2","character":"Lieutenant George Wydell","original_title":"The Devil's Rejects","poster_path":"/yAmK6Ev2IeI8VqNbagpF3yxPOSD.jpg","release_date":"2005-07-22","adult":false},{"id":296391,"title":"30 Days in Hell: The Making of 'The Devil's Rejects'","character":"Himself","original_title":"30 Days in Hell: The Making of 'The Devil's Rejects'","release_date":"2005-11-08","adult":false},{"id":285923,"title":"刑房","character":"Lt.
