{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"Records of his death did not surface until being researched 21 years after his body was found in a hotel . He died alone.\n\nAnimated, freckle-faced Mickey was recommended to Hal Roach  for the \"Our Gang\" series by still photographer Gene Kornman, a good  friend of the family who was also the father of the Gang's original  female member Mary Kornman.\n\nThe very first Hal Roach film in the series was shot in the spring of 1922 and released on November 5th. It was entitled simply Our Gang  (1922) and told the story of widowed mother and store owner who was  losing her customers due to the unethical methods of a nearby  competitor. Mickey and the rest of the kids decide to stage a show for  her with pet animals and its success leads to a resurgence of business  once again. Sadly, no negatives or complete prints exist and is  considered a lost film.\n\nOne of ten children, his actor father, Richard Daniels occasionally appeared with Mickey in the \"Our Gang\" shorts. They also appeared together in several of Harold Lloyd's features. Mickey's brother, Leonard, worked in the transportation department for the Roach Studios for at least two decades.","birthday":"1914-10-11","deathday":"1970-08-20","id":1172948,"imdb_id":"nm0200040","name":"Mickey
