{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["June Bryde","June Gitelson","June Gittleson"],"biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJune Gittelson (May 6, 1910 – November 28, 1993) was an American film actress. She appeared in over 70 films between 1928 and 1945.  Due to her rotund figure, Gittleson was often cast as a love interest who often intimidated her husband or boyfriend. Modern viewers will recognize Gittelson in her appearances in several early Three Stooges films such as Slippery Silks, Dizzy Doctors, and The Sitter Downers. Perhaps her most famous role was as Minnie in the Stooge film False Alarms, in which she played the large and man-hungry lady pursuing the affections of a reluctant Curly Howard. Curly memorably contacts Moe and Larry, saying \"Hello, Moe? You'd better come over. You're missing one of the biggest things in your life!\" In this role, she also remarked, \"I grow on people!\" Curly's response was, \"so do warts!\"  Gittelson died in Northridge, California on November 28, 1993, aged 83.","birthday":"1910-05-06","deathday":"1993-11-28","id":1069732,"imdb_id":"nm0321204","name":"June Gittelson","place_of_birth":"Los Angeles, California,
