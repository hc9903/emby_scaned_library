Born in San Francisco, California, he acted in live theater, appearing in Henrietta in 1888 at the Hollis Street Theater in Boston and in the touring production of The Senator in 1892 and 1893. He made his Broadway debut in 1899. He made his first film appearance was with The L-KO Kompany in 1914 at the age of forty-six. In 1916, Bergman started working with Charlie Chaplin, beginning with The Pawnshop. For the rest of his career, Bergman remained as a character actor for Chaplin and worked as a studio assistant, including Assistant Director. He played in many Chaplin shorts and later features, including The Immigrant, The Gold Rush and The Circus. Bergman's last on-screen appearance was in Modern Times as a restaurant manager, and his final off-screen contribution was for The Great Dictator in 1940. Chaplin helped Bergman finance a restaurant in Hollywood named Henry's, which became a popular spot for celebrities as a precursor to the later Brown Derby restaurant. Henry Bergman continued to be associated with the Chaplin Studios until his death from a heart attack in 1946. He is interred in the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.","birthday":"1868-02-22","deathday":"1946-10-22","id":14438,"imdb_id":"nm0074788","name":"Henry
