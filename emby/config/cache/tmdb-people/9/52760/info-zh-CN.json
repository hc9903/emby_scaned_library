{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Alan Hugh Dale","Άλαν Ντέιλ"],"biography":"Alan Hugh Dale is a New Zealand actor. As a child, Dale developed a love of theatre and also became a rugby player. After retiring from the sport he took on a number of professions to support his family, before deciding to become a professional actor at the age of 27. With work limited in New Zealand, Dale moved to Australia, where he played Dr. John Forrest in The Young Doctors from 1979 to 1982. He later appeared as Jim Robinson in Neighbours, a part he played for eight years. The character is the role Dale is most associated with in Australia and the United Kingdom. He left the series when he fell out with the producers over the pay he and the rest of the cast received.\n\nAfter leaving Neighbours, Dale became typecast as Robinson in Australia and struggled to find work. His career was revitalised after he relocated to the United States in 2000. Since then he has had roles in many American series including prominent parts in The O.C. (as Caleb Nichol) and Ugly Betty (as Bradford Meade), as well as recurring and guest roles in Lost, 24, NCIS, ER, The West Wing, The X-Files and The Lone Gunmen. Dale has also appeared in minor roles in films such as Star Trek Nemesis, Hollywood Homicide and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull as well as the London West End production of Spamalot. Dale has been married to former Miss Australia Tracey Pearson since 1990 and has four children.","birthday":"1947-05-06","homepage":"https://lmcm.com.au/artists/alan-dale/","id":52760,"imdb_id":"nm0197638","name":"Alan Dale","place_of_birth":"Dunedin, Otago, New Zealand","popularity":2.325,"profile_path":"/3BcpSoKBOwHX0wxaPZpOJ5buO89.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":75206,"title":"Houseboat Horror","character":"Evans","original_title":"Houseboat Horror","release_date":"1989-06-30","adult":false},{"id":52477,"title":"Alien Cargo","character":"Eichhorn, Explorer Dolphin","original_title":"Alien Cargo","poster_path":"/nGktETuqS4qKkPYH90FmPNIvVqq.jpg","release_date":"1999-01-28","adult":false},{"id":82881,"title":"魔发奇缘番外篇：麻烦不断","character":"Priest (voice)","original_title":"Tangled Ever After","poster_path":"/k2QtH6K8lmI4jAFL6ioPxKR4d0H.jpg","release_date":"2012-01-13","adult":false},{"id":46261,"title":"黑夜勿怕","character":"Jacoby","original_title":"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark","poster_path":"/gOOLSnMTB6iEsqRedRvgUY61yMH.jpg","release_date":"2010-11-06","adult":false},{"id":102947,"title":"First Daughter","character":"Daly","original_title":"First Daughter","poster_path":"/zeC1xrsfVUkIm8tmHS8K31OzgyI.jpg","release_date":"1999-08-15","adult":false},{"id":289416,"title":"灵异恩典","character":"Father John","original_title":"Grace","poster_path":"/6ikvuPIo1kGuRQz70l3ecissZLS.jpg","release_date":"2014-10-28","adult":false},{"id":38321,"title":"驱魔者","character":"Monsignor Chamberlain","original_title":"Priest","poster_path":"/mPYj0EVqfGdABMigYal2sUydMjP.jpg","release_date":"2011-05-05","adult":false},{"id":45156,"title":"想爱趁现在","character":"Dr. Sanders","original_title":"A Little Bit of Heaven","poster_path":"/9rO0YfsV9z8P4tlpKbryUwcHHIV.jpg","release_date":"2011-02-03","adult":false},{"id":217,"title":"夺宝奇兵4：水晶头骨","character":"General Ross","original_title":"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull","poster_path":"/56As6XEM1flWvprX4LgkPl8ii4K.jpg","release_date":"2008-05-21","adult":false},{"id":72174,"title":"Doomsday Prophecy","character":"General Slate","original_title":"Doomsday Prophecy","poster_path":"/e034GExPBoilqua2QSQy80Wlx4v.jpg","release_date":"2011-08-13","adult":false},{"id":57551,"title":"The Extreme Team","character":"Richard Knowles","original_title":"The Extreme Team","poster_path":"/bCXzCQFWqawHn1XvVHGsZBx0S0B.jpg","release_date":"2003-01-01","adult":false},{"id":330793,"title":"Happy New Year","character":"Bill","original_title":"Happy New Year","poster_path":"/vowLaiyeSiZEtJtwm5AKCEXvzCo.jpg","release_date":"2011-09-15","adult":false},{"id":438747,"title":"魔发奇缘：幸福前奏","character":"The Vicar (voice)","original_title":"Tangled: Before Ever After","poster_path":"/48biV3KlOVd8ObJCPfRsDVChvYH.jpg","release_date":"2017-03-10","adult":false},{"id":11375,"title":"好莱坞重案组","character":"Commander Preston","original_title":"Hollywood Homicide","poster_path":"/15xHKnXY6WmWcmwiWhzYY9e60Nc.jpg","release_date":"2003-06-09","adult":false},{"id":201,"title":"星际迷航10：复仇女神","character":"Praetor Hiren","original_title":"Star Trek: Nemesis","poster_path":"/cldAwhvBmOv9jrd3bXWuqRHoXyq.jpg","release_date":"2002-12-13","adult":false},{"id":65754,"title":"龙纹身的女孩","character":"Detective Isaksson","original_title":"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo","poster_path":"/v8kzHyAuUKkBBZc7NPijYJFzOK3.jpg","release_date":"2011-12-14","adult":false},{"id":188222,"title":"明星伙伴","character":"John Ellis","original_title":"Entourage","poster_path":"/y8zMue7ibjg7vXma6XE5tkQ3KiS.jpg","release_date":"2015-06-03","adult":false},{"id":100402,"title":"美国队长2：冬日战士","character":"Councilman Rockwell","original_title":"Captain America: The Winter Soldier","poster_path":"/q4KkxmFYRKU2jldXIbsY4VsQynS.jpg","release_date":"2014-03-20","adult":false},{"id":10589,"title":"日落之后","character":"Security Chief","original_title":"After the Sunset","poster_path":"/wMvkiwh2wqtCtCT955lquPqwcaz.jpg","release_date":"2004-11-12","adult":false}],"crew":[]},"images":{"profiles":[{"file_path":"/3BcpSoKBOwHX0wxaPZpOJ5buO89.jpg","width":559,"height":839,"aspect_ratio":0.66626936829559,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"nm0197638","freebase_mid":"/m/03_2td","freebase_id":"/en/alan_dale","tvrage_id":27789}}
