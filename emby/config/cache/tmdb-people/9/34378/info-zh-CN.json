{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["小田切みき","小田切美喜"],"biography":"Miki Odagiri (小田切美喜) was known primarily for her important and timeless role as the upbeat office girl in Akira Kurosawa's classic Ikiru opposite Takashi Shimura, whose character is dying of cancer, and Miki, as Toyo Odagiri, inspires him to live... just by being herself: bubbly, spontaneous, and optimistic. Her character is also filled with blunt sarcasm that was extremely rare in movies of the early-1950's. Perhaps Miki and Takashi's most memorable scene is when she's telling him the nicknames she created for their fellow workmates... including his! Sadly, beyond Ikiru, finding the handful of other Japanese movies she appeared in, especially on DVD or Blu Ray, is extremely difficult. But she left an impression in what's considered not only one of the legendary Kurosawa's greatest achievements, but one of the best movies ever made, worldwide.","birthday":"1930-06-29","deathday":"2006-11-28","id":34378,"imdb_id":"nm0643887","name":"Miki Odagiri","place_of_birth":"Sendagaya, Tokyo, Japan","popularity":0.84,"profile_path":"/9pfgepQ89gE9wZyHLnMM3tMRV1Y.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":3782,"title":"生之欲","character":"Toyo","original_title":"生きる","poster_path":"/b7QquFirLZeJ02zIXtxbFaiZy7s.jpg","release_date":"1952-10-09","adult":false},{"id":473011,"title":"海の純情","character":"Yumiko","original_title":"海の純情","release_date":"1956-06-07","adult":false},{"id":671037,"title":"落日の血闘","character":"Okatsu","original_title":"落日の血闘","poster_path":"/mw86JQKQyLioPUwZx3ynTypJDkv.jpg","release_date":"1955-05-24","adult":false},{"id":464712,"title":"太陽のない街","character":"","original_title":"太陽のない街","poster_path":"/9jTfN0pop7HOslSJdKYb8XV21SF.jpg","release_date":"1954-06-24","adult":false},{"id":523631,"title":"Kurosawa Akira: Tsukuru to iu koto wa subarashii: Ikiru","character":"Interviewee","original_title":"Kurosawa Akira: Tsukuru to iu koto wa subarashii: Ikiru","release_date":"2002-10-25","adult":false},{"id":148513,"title":"雁","character":"Oume","original_title":"雁","release_date":"1953-12-31","adult":false},{"id":256663,"title":"月は上りぬ","character":"","original_title":"月は上りぬ","poster_path":"/avCzwbmELbziZREXzWjzIODM2e5.jpg","release_date":"1955-01-08","adult":false},{"id":398870,"title":"母なき子","character":"Miyoko","original_title":"母なき子","release_date":"1955-12-04","adult":false},{"id":262629,"title":"ひめゆりの塔","character":"","original_title":"ひめゆりの塔","poster_path":"/q8H5Y8gOh3xi1KcwOxuvgSSjhly.jpg","release_date":"1953-01-09","adult":false},{"id":489554,"title":"愛のお荷物","character":"Teru","original_title":"愛のお荷物","poster_path":"/pEPMS9R8rj4XGLUXwEhaRrMFzUE.jpg","release_date":"1955-03-18","adult":false},{"id":397977,"title":"ニコヨン物語","character":"","original_title":"ニコヨン物語","release_date":"1956-09-11","adult":false},{"id":37293,"title":"监视","character":"","original_title":"張込み","poster_path":"/fDRzRJF2PcK4Gy0tCDWq8WHXDWV.jpg","release_date":"1958-01-15","adult":false},{"id":354580,"title":"警察日記","character":"Momoyo","original_title":"警察日記","release_date":"1955-02-03","adult":false},{"id":198454,"title":"親鸞 白い道","character":"","original_title":"親鸞 白い道","release_date":"1987-06-02","adult":false}],"crew":[]},"images":{"profiles":[{"file_path":"/9pfgepQ89gE9wZyHLnMM3tMRV1Y.jpg","width":701,"height":1050,"aspect_ratio":0.66761904761905,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"nm0643887","tvrage_id":0}}
