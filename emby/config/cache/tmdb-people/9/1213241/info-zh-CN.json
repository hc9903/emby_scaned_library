{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"Sylvia Lewis, born in York, Pennsylvania, first performed as a young  child in the last days of vaudeville in Baltimore, Maryland. She  received her first classical training as a scholarship student at the  Peabody Conservatory of Music, studying dance, voice and piano. Coming  to Hollywood at the age of 12, she continued to study and secured parts  in such films as Singin' in the Rain (1952) and Red Garters (1954) as a dancer, then in Drums of Tahiti  (1954) as an actress. Later she added choreography to her list of  credits, which began while she was a regular featured character on the  TV series Where's Raymond? (1953), that starred Ray Bolger and ran for 60 episodes on ABC. She choreographed dozens of TV shows since then, including Who's the Boss? (1984) and Married with Children (1987). Guest appearances on shows like The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961), The Beverly Hillbillies (1962) and Gomer Pyle: USMC  (1964), plus a healthy stage career on both coasts, earned her a  reputation as a triple-threat performer. Her career in theater,  nightclubs, films, and TV which spanned 50 years continued until the  1990s. She now lives in Thousand Oaks, California, with her husband of  30 years, attorney Philip Gunning. She has one daughter (Catherine) from  her early marriage to director John Rich.","birthday":"1931-04-22","id":1213241,"imdb_id":"nm0507785","name":"Sylvia Lewis","place_of_birth":"York, PA","popularity":0.6,"credits":{"cast":[{"id":114359,"title":"Drums of Tahiti","character":"Mawai","original_title":"Drums of Tahiti","poster_path":"/nFcVa2RoZFMGYHOFDITjhZ2gw0N.jpg","release_date":"1954-04-23","adult":false},{"id":109014,"title":"Hook, Line and Sinker","character":"Karlotta Hammercher","original_title":"Hook, Line and Sinker","poster_path":"/xSTXm6v96ld4VLQJPBtsv2eJNIE.jpg","release_date":"1969-06-06","adult":false},{"id":156566,"title":"Red Garters","character":"Ensemble Dancer (uncredited)","original_title":"Red Garters","poster_path":"/6DurK9hCsu0eIY0j9WCXNzzQz2L.jpg","release_date":"1954-02-09","adult":false},{"id":28333,"title":"猎艳高手","character":"Miss Cartilage","original_title":"The Ladies Man","poster_path":"/c15TotHYrXPZSzjZCBfbup3fz4V.jpg","release_date":"1961-06-21","adult":false},{"id":872,"title":"雨中曲","character":"Female Tango Dancer (uncredited)","original_title":"Singin' in the Rain","poster_path":"/w03EiJVHP8Un77boQeE7hg9DVdU.jpg","release_date":"1952-04-09","adult":false},{"id":16618,"title":"Hans Christian Andersen","character":"Danseuse / Corps de Ballet (uncredited)","original_title":"Hans Christian Andersen","poster_path":"/5Cv7JshrTBrciltEX9TXzB28ito.jpg","release_date":"1952-12-19","adult":false},{"id":30801,"title":"Son of Paleface","character":"Saloon Dancer (uncredited)","original_title":"Son of Paleface","poster_path":"/eqAs4bnBy07lEU1yFA1oxSM5n5t.jpg","release_date":"1952-07-14","adult":false},{"id":139922,"title":"She's Working Her Way Through College","character":"Ensemble Dancer (uncredited)","original_title":"She's Working Her Way Through College","poster_path":"/9IgrFKp7vyjwWbhWOJr2XoDIrwz.jpg","release_date":"1952-07-09","adult":false}],"crew":[]},"images":{"profiles":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"nm0507785","freebase_mid":"/m/03c7p9t","freebase_id":"/en/sylvia_lewis","tvrage_id":40548}}
