While still in the wrestling game, Roach broke into acting with a bit part in the Stanley Kubrick\n\n filmBarry Lyndon (1975). He quickly became popular as an enforcer or warrior figure and appeared on-screen with some of Hollywood's biggest names. Many people would remember him as the muscle-bound, bald German guard who hands out a beating toHarrison Ford in Les aventuriers de l'arche perdue (1981), before being cut down by a spinning plane propeller.\n\nIn other film roles, Roach nearly eliminates 007 Sean Connery\n\n in the Bond film Jamais plus jamais (1983), in dual roles as a resurrected demon and as a fierce warrior, he fought Arnold Schwarzenegger in the Conan sequel Conan le destructeur (1984), and was back as a ferocious Indian guard pummeling poor Harrison Ford once again inIndiana Jones et le temple maudit (1984), before falling into a rock crusher.\n\nHe also appeared in Indiana Jones et la dernière croisade\n\n (1989), Kalidor - la légende du talisman (1985) and Robin des bois: Prince des voleurs (1991). Apart from his film activity, Pat ran a gymnasium in Birmingham, operated a used appliance business in the local markets and was known as a warm-hearted and genial man who was happy to chat with admiring fanatics, sign autographs and pose for photographs.\n\nRoach was also very popular with English television audiences for his portrayal of gentle giant \"Brian 'Bomber' Busbridge\" in the series Auf Wiedersehen, Pet\n\n (1983) and was scheduled to appear in the fifth series of the show, when he died of cancer on July 17, 2004. He was 67 years old.  - IMDb Mini Biography","birthday":"1937-05-19","deathday":"2004-07-17","id":10942,"imdb_id":"nm0730053","name":"Pat Roach","place_of_birth":"Birmingham - England - UK","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":"/lFvFJR4rjM1AMkOPHc9wklUXBG6.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":78178,"title":"Crust","character":"The Bull","original_title":"Crust","release_date":"2003-12-12","adult":false},{"id":847,"title":"风云际会","character":"General Kael","original_title":"Willow","poster_path":"/6tXkG9r7Lt1w7tmOguJdYcRbyYO.jpg","release_date":"1988-05-01","adult":false},{"id":65596,"title":"Unidentified Flying Oddball","character":"Oaf","original_title":"Unidentified Flying Oddball","poster_path":"/7A1W1js0sFOZdOgnxYlAJ4Hauwh.jpg","release_date":"1979-07-10","adult":false},{"id":9626,"title":"女王神剑","character":"Brytag","original_title":"Red Sonja","poster_path":"/qYJFrmSjy0HpzmvnIuGpuFUzXbs.jpg","release_date":"1985-04-09","adult":false},{"id":54833,"title":"The Big Man","character":"Billy","original_title":"The Big Man","poster_path":"/wtNH54wZ0lUnBb1WQlxv1Gm25xG.jpg","release_date":"1990-08-31","adult":false},{"id":9610,"title":"毁灭者柯南","character":"Man Ape / Toth-Amon","original_title":"Conan the Destroyer","poster_path":"/tYtWSH9mq6YoIOAyZtluHnzbPvE.jpg","release_date":"1984-06-29","adult":false},{"id":513910,"title":"Masters of the Canvas","character":"Himself","original_title":"Masters of the Canvas","poster_path":"/iZxzFsyLOrOzsDtrrGnPb3REHyP.jpg","release_date":"1992-01-31","adult":false},{"id":10323,"title":"泰坦之战","character":"Hephaestus","original_title":"Clash of the Titans","poster_path":"/fySpRyxDkV3MiEJqRmZ9mmakRse.jpg","release_date":"1981-03-15","adult":false},{"id":149477,"title":"The Zany Adventures of Robin Hood","character":"Little John","original_title":"The Zany Adventures of Robin Hood","poster_path":"/3RKHf3yfQ3X8AcZTqSexWnU9n8l.jpg","release_date":"1984-05-22","adult":false},{"id":48198,"title":"Wings of Fame","character":"","original_title":"Wings of Fame","poster_path":"/c0sz1x2rFUMQyOrip3RkQli61CB.jpg","release_date":"1990-03-23","adult":false},{"id":17832,"title":"Kull the Conqueror","character":"Zulcki","original_title":"Kull the Conqueror","poster_path":"/hMIEDTUAX6Clwpm4LpXGp1Lsk9m.jpg","release_date":"1997-08-29","adult":false},{"id":24577,"title":"Rising Damp","character":"Rugby Player","original_title":"Rising Damp","poster_path":"/iGoBOXN9TRLEJM76PRXfNwit3rY.jpg","release_date":"1980-05-03","adult":false},{"id":39578,"title":"The Monster Club","character":"Great Uncle","original_title":"The Monster Club","poster_path":"/7Qm4S5wMUJZGZxNIlAe1yMD7DAw.jpg","release_date":"1981-04-11","adult":false},{"id":41946,"title":"The Return of the Musketeers","character":"French Executioner","original_title":"The Return of the Musketeers","poster_path":"/hWO6U4NVUhLGQiZeZXVUvqIsmFz.jpg","release_date":"1989-04-12","adult":false},{"id":36670,"title":"007外传：巡弋飞弹","character":"Lippe","original_title":"Never Say Never Again","poster_path":"/xGF7Kcq4aRA8p69IN3rKMA4onDG.jpg","release_date":"1983-10-07","adult":false},{"id":36758,"title":"淑女本色","character":"Strongman","original_title":"The Portrait of a Lady","poster_path":"/yoUuMtWTQXzfARYE0nF7Nn7gRuS.jpg","release_date":"1996-10-17","adult":false},{"id":8367,"title":"侠盗王子罗宾汉","character":"Celtic Chieftain","original_title":"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves","poster_path":"/hbRnWUNJkKKVN5mkcuC5ooqjE4e.jpg","release_date":"1991-06-14","adult":false},{"id":85,"title":"夺宝奇兵：法柜奇兵","character":"Giant Sherpa / 1st Mechanic","original_title":"Raiders of the Lost Ark","poster_path":"/awUGN7ZCNq2EUTdpVaHDX23anOZ.jpg","release_date":"1981-06-12","adult":false},{"id":185,"title":"发条橙","character":"Milkbar Bouncer","original_title":"A Clockwork Orange","poster_path":"/4sHeTAp65WrSSuc05nRBKddhBxO.jpg","release_date":"1971-12-18","adult":false},{"id":87,"title":"夺宝奇兵2：魔域奇兵","character":"Chief Guard","original_title":"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom","poster_path":"/x73YxnH2u0jeJzIHUR3ufXQ0nRH.jpg","release_date":"1984-05-23","adult":false},{"id":3175,"title":"巴里·林登","character":"Toole","original_title":"Barry Lyndon","poster_path":"/djl9e9koMRaOUS8tk2nRBlpNyVE.jpg","release_date":"1975-11-26","adult":false},{"id":89,"title":"夺宝奇兵3：圣战奇兵","character":"Gestapo","original_title":"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade","poster_path":"/sizg1AU8f8JDZX4QIgE4pjUMBvx.jpg","release_date":"1989-05-24","adult":false}],"crew":[]},"images":{"profiles":[{"file_path":"/ml3pVDTbZ3lUUuRmcONJsowunHy.jpg","width":300,"height":450,"aspect_ratio":0.66666666666667,"vote_average":5.172,"vote_count":1},{"file_path":"/lFvFJR4rjM1AMkOPHc9wklUXBG6.jpg","width":913,"height":1369,"aspect_ratio":0.66691015339664,"vote_average":5.312,"vote_count":1}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"nm0730053","freebase_mid":"/m/036m4c","freebase_id":"/en/pat_roach","tvrage_id":13629}}
