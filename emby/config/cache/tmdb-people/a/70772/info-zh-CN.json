{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Kathy Mullen"],"biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nKathryn \"Kathy\" Mullen is an actress, voice actress, and puppeteer most closely associated with Jim Henson projects. She began performing on The Muppet Show in its third season, primarily as Gaffer the Backstage Cat. She also voice directed Dog City for Nelvana, worked as a designer for The Muppet Movie, a performing assistant for Yoda on The Empire Strikes Back, and was one of the creators of Between the Lions. While reprising this character for several Muppet movies, she also created the character of Mokey - a gentle, New Age style Fraggle - on Henson's Fraggle Rock. She performed the Gelfling Kira in the movie The Dark Crystal, Allegra on \"Allegra's Window\", and Leona the Lion on \"Between the Lions\".\n\nKathy Mullen, with her husband, former Muppet designer Michael K. Frith, has joined forces with British charity \"No Strings\" to create a film for children in Afghanistan, warning of the dangers of land mines. In the film, \"The Story of the Little Carpet Boy,\" one puppet loses several limbs before he learns to avoid land mines completely. Kathy and Michael picked up the idea from Johnie McGlade, an emergency aid worker who used a scruffy rabbit puppet to bring smiles to the faces of people who had lived through earthquakes, hunger, or genocide.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Kathryn Mullen, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia","birthday":"1940-02-10","id":70772,"imdb_id":"nm0612020","name":"Kathryn Mullen","place_of_birth":"New York City, New York, U.S.A","popularity":1.138,"credits":{"cast":[{"id":11639,"title":"黑水晶","character":"Kira","original_title":"The Dark Crystal","poster_path":"/dWYrAw2VyFUuDbaQPD1Z38uCFxY.jpg","release_date":"1982-12-17","adult":false},{"id":47670,"title":"The Christmas Toy","character":"Apple the Doll","original_title":"The Christmas Toy","poster_path":"/jVgC8FJoJ3xDM4GeqLkevjp8Ush.jpg","release_date":"1986-12-06","adult":false},{"id":563614,"title":"The Bells of Fraggle Rock","character":"Mokey Fraggle (voice)","original_title":"The Bells of Fraggle Rock","poster_path":"/68vvqwPuWJKDNoAEAmLyMJxMFmn.jpg","release_date":"1984-12-24","adult":false},{"id":695023,"title":"Fraggles Look For Jobs","character":"Mokey (voice)","original_title":"Fraggles Look For Jobs","poster_path":"/oey222ScrLfphYfkrbHegwQ0jRj.jpg","release_date":"1986-05-16","adult":false},{"id":36536,"title":"Follow That Bird","character":"Feathered Friends Magistrate / Grouch Diner Patron / Little Girl / Additional Muppets (voice)","original_title":"Follow That Bird","poster_path":"/vv9fcYL2NhgKYi9dP8xWICCiLK3.jpg","release_date":"1985-08-02","adult":false},{"id":63252,"title":"Of Muppets & Men: The Making of the Muppet Show","character":"Herself","original_title":"Of Muppets & Men: The Making of the Muppet Show","release_date":"1981-01-01","adult":false},{"id":154567,"title":"Fraggle Rock - Live By the Rule of the Rock","original_title":"Fraggle Rock - Live By the Rule of the Rock","poster_path":"/A9f1JhUF0rCs3DKC1DByj7ggvWA.jpg","release_date":"2005-01-01","adult":false},{"id":239178,"title":"Reflections of 'The Dark Crystal'","character":"Herself","original_title":"Reflections of 'The Dark Crystal'","release_date":"2007-08-01","adult":false},{"id":114671,"title":"The Muppets Go Hollywood","character":"Various Muppets","original_title":"The Muppets Go Hollywood","poster_path":"/ytdirqn3SxUdnIePMfdKUfTONNl.jpg","release_date":"1979-05-16","adult":false},{"id":13247,"title":"A Muppet Family Christmas","character":"Mokey Fraggle (voice)","original_title":"A Muppet Family Christmas","poster_path":"/pgvcXRqHxpDLN6dUcHKRAgAZGv8.jpg","release_date":"1987-12-16","adult":false},{"id":163884,"title":"The World of 'The Dark Crystal'","character":"Herself","original_title":"The World of 'The Dark Crystal'","release_date":"1983-01-09","adult":false},{"id":45731,"title":"John Denver and the Muppets: A Christmas Together","character":"","original_title":"John Denver and the Muppets: A Christmas Together","poster_path":"/gEauLxAkahdHvl9yECybynkFg99.jpg","release_date":"1979-12-05","adult":false},{"id":78491,"title":"Rocky Mountain Holiday with John Denver and the Muppets","character":"","original_title":"Rocky Mountain Holiday with John Denver and the Muppets","poster_path":"/q6xdyPKI1KytagJ7USKmHstRxRV.jpg","release_date":"1983-05-12","adult":false},{"id":547350,"title":"Muppet Video: The Kermit and Piggy Story","character":"","original_title":"Muppet Video: The Kermit and Piggy Story","poster_path":"/2eSD7jlvzdet9I92eQQ1XboPpI3.jpg","release_date":"1985-01-01","adult":false},{"id":114668,"title":"The Fantastic Miss Piggy Show","character":"Various Muppets","original_title":"The Fantastic Miss Piggy Show","poster_path":"/q2UqaOJCSTjCURycNe3hSz8Fv5p.jpg","release_date":"1982-09-17","adult":false},{"id":637198,"title":"Muppet Sing Alongs: It's Not Easy Being Green","character":"Mokey Fraggle / Frog (voice) (archive footage)","original_title":"Muppet Sing Alongs: It's Not Easy Being Green","poster_path":"/z2p3HCE0OGZYFqCJEQ3L9cA2l7m.jpg","release_date":"1994-02-18","adult":false},{"id":1891,"title":"星球大战5：帝国反击战","character":"Performing Assistant for Yoda","original_title":"The Empire Strikes Back","poster_path":"/vND96Mn2OVyuvuo3kHqZQhT7Ttd.jpg","release_date":"1980-05-20","adult":false},{"id":11899,"title":"The Muppets Take Manhattan","character":"Jill the Frog (voice)","original_title":"The Muppets Take Manhattan","poster_path":"/lxOQEr3wOrDEy0VINfSoEZlIYEO.jpg","release_date":"1984-06-27","adult":false},{"id":11176,"title":"大青蛙布偶电影","character":"Camilla (assistant)","original_title":"The Muppet Movie","poster_path":"/g4xw8UUdpvmMg0kKbhD1dJvHqDH.jpg","release_date":"1979-05-31","adult":false},{"id":168699,"title":"The World of Jim Henson","character":"Herself (archive footage)","original_title":"The World of Jim Henson","release_date":"1994-11-23","adult":false}],"crew":[]},"images":{"profiles":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"nm0612020","freebase_mid":"/m/07gm05","freebase_id":"/en/kathryn_mullen","tvrage_id":0}}
