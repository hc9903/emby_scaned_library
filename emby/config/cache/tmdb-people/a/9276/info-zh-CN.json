{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[" Stephen Eastin ","Steve Easton"],"biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nSteve Eastin (born June 22, 1948) is an American character actor. He has appeared in nearly 150 television and film roles throughout his decades long career.\n\nEastin was born in Colorado, where he began to study acting at the young age of six at his local theater. He received his Actor Equity card at age 16 when he performed in two musicals choreographed by Micheal Bennet. Later, he attended the University of Northern Colorado where he appeared in several productions at the Little Theater of the Rockies, whose alumni include Nick Nolte.\n\nAfter college, Eastin received a fellowship to teach at the University of Arizona where he appeared in his first SAG role opposite Clint Eastwood in Joe Kidd. It was shortly after this when Eastin moved to Los Angeles to further pursue his acting career, enrolling in the Charles Conrad Studio upon arrival in 1974.\n\nWhile attending Charles' class, Eastin became interested in teaching acting as well. In 1991, he founded his own acting school, The Steve Eastin Studio. The studio believes in what Eastin refers to as \"Choiceless Awareness\", where the actors do not read into the script, nor prepare their \"beats\" or think about what or how they may read their lines. Instead, the actors are encouraged to be in the moment and let their natural, emotional power take over and thus tap into the vast collective unconscious all humans are capable of attuning themselves to.\n\nEastin is best known for appearing in such films as Field of Dreams (1989), Con Air (1997) and A Man Apart (2003), where he developed a reputation as the tough guy with a heart of gold underneath. He played opposite Leonardo Dicaprio in two pivotal scenes in Catch Me if You Can (2002). Eastin has worked with such directors as Steven Spielberg, Brian De Palma, and Jason Reitman.\n\nEastin is also known for his numerous television appearances throughout the years on such shows as Little House on the Prairie, CHiPS, T.J. Hooker, St. Elsewhere and L.A. Law.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Steve Eastin, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.​","birthday":"1948-06-22","id":9276,"imdb_id":"nm0247611","name":"Steve Eastin","place_of_birth":"Colorado, USA","popularity":2.112,"profile_path":"/jb7fyTLCdUqMCwS9mcHCScYlvWe.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":56708,"title":"Last Man Standing","character":"Seagrove","original_title":"Last Man Standing","poster_path":"/cDFpGnb41GbPmIrgUlDomkgTIQt.jpg","release_date":"1995-01-01","adult":false},{"id":88773,"title":"Little Bigfoot 2: The Journey Home","character":"Cavendish","original_title":"Little Bigfoot 2: The Journey Home","poster_path":"/2MYMiR0Wc7txwBFKVjUwssfxQRx.jpg","release_date":"1997-01-01","adult":false},{"id":409287,"title":"Jesus Comes to Town","character":"The Man","original_title":"Jesus Comes to Town","release_date":"2010-04-17","adult":false},{"id":260019,"title":"Sleeping with the Devil","character":"Wes Dubrovich","original_title":"Sleeping with the Devil","release_date":"1997-04-22","adult":false},{"id":100761,"title":"Peril","character":"Detective Marks","original_title":"Peril","poster_path":"/j5RM5YlUEK2mvLweYU1XAcDejwZ.jpg","release_date":"2001-01-17","adult":false},{"id":408269,"title":"Desperado: Badlands Justice","character":"Ledon","original_title":"Desperado: Badlands Justice","poster_path":"/hZAOGh9zqy7tNPYcGQsi4zyq6ZJ.jpg","release_date":"1989-12-17","adult":false},{"id":8409,"title":"单刀直入","character":"Ty Frost","original_title":"A Man Apart","poster_path":"/z0JUBNk4BTBmeMOudrRH9GnOmK0.jpg","release_date":"2003-04-04","adult":false},{"id":67740,"title":"Butcher, Baker, Nightmare Maker","character":"Coach Tom Landers","original_title":"Butcher, Baker, Nightmare Maker","poster_path":"/oiExjoIxKmH0IwPSgjl7l4rrATi.jpg","release_date":"1982-02-24","adult":false},{"id":7270,"title":"火柴人","character":"Mr. Schaffer","original_title":"Matchstick Men","poster_path":"/mW6HZe1aoipzH8U7ucjma6E3LLx.jpg","release_date":"2003-09-01","adult":false},{"id":10053,"title":"When a Stranger Calls","character":"Detective Hines","original_title":"When a Stranger Calls","poster_path":"/h0ZmU7BZDWBucq1FvblfeAWUkad.jpg","release_date":"2006-02-03","adult":false},{"id":51422,"title":"Agent Red","character":"Captain Russert","original_title":"Agent Red","poster_path":"/3t3d4L4kwEop8qkvEwaQ79xjhM6.jpg","release_date":"2000-09-13","adult":false},{"id":640,"title":"猫鼠游戏","character":"Paul Morgan","original_title":"Catch Me If You Can","poster_path":"/laHeAH6qG6iBCUfyX0OnnFZBsCM.jpg","release_date":"2002-12-25","adult":false},{"id":24702,"title":"地表","character":"Detective Russell","original_title":"Shallow Ground","poster_path":"/y4zThiFpVPFrYWLPy9j0jpyAM1O.jpg","release_date":"2005-06-28","adult":false},{"id":456178,"title":"鸣枪警告","character":"","original_title":"Warning Shot","poster_path":"/kGeDlD8kH4eWxzIKdyiG8IPpnoE.jpg","release_date":"2018-09-14","adult":false},{"id":27058,"title":"Diplomatic Siege","character":"Bates","original_title":"Diplomatic Siege","poster_path":"/iAahz2oxMjdDRsXWdebzNKlBdyq.jpg","release_date":"1999-11-17","adult":false},{"id":115666,"title":"Nightmare on the 13th Floor","character":"Hotel Doorman","original_title":"Nightmare on the 13th Floor","poster_path":"/r60QI9Cd1QlZ1Dp8dwZSMS5KKXQ.jpg","release_date":"1990-10-31","adult":false},{"id":295196,"title":"Watercolor Postcards","character":"Morgan","original_title":"Watercolor Postcards","poster_path":"/vuDBVIWKG5dJbnwYOu38sPVOi9K.jpg","release_date":"2013-01-01","adult":false},{"id":40487,"title":"机械战争","character":"Boles","original_title":"Robot Wars","poster_path":"/hsABDZyidGJseto9dPQujsi8M9R.jpg","release_date":"1993-01-01","adult":false},{"id":1701,"title":"空中监狱","character":"Guard Falzon","original_title":"Con Air","poster_path":"/7PCCWBSparK5fquZtg9DMr8JIAm.jpg","release_date":"1997-06-01","adult":false},{"id":86254,"title":"Crash Landing","character":"Detective Cobb","original_title":"Crash Landing","poster_path":"/AaZXh1zrdIVgtgpTW4VHbsWQk6Q.jpg","release_date":"2006-07-11","adult":false},{"id":267974,"title":"Crisis in Mid-air","character":"Jamieson","original_title":"Crisis in Mid-air","poster_path":"/bPZlrSY3qqi1z7L8sA4B7yqBnKz.jpg","release_date":"1979-02-13","adult":false},{"id":337787,"title":"The Clone Master","character":"Huberman","original_title":"The Clone Master","poster_path":"/1ERmi6jvfALh0s1zz9lmSHdz1Yf.jpg","release_date":"1978-09-14","adult":false},{"id":121817,"title":"The Sweeper","character":"Richard","original_title":"The Sweeper","poster_path":"/gGPuTOvujFURpjrn5Z9CYytnL6B.jpg","release_date":"1996-06-25","adult":false},{"id":2323,"title":"梦幻之地","character":"Eddie Cicotte -
