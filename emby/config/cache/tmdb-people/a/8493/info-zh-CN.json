{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Ruth Patricia White"],"biography":"Ruth White was born on April 24, 1914 in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, USA as Ruth Patricia White. She was an actress, known for Du silence et des ombres... (1962),Macadam cowboy (1969) and Pendez-les haut et court (1968). She died on December 3, 1969 in Perth Amboy.\n\nHer death, from cancer, was sudden and unexpected.\n\nShe spent the final decade of her life as one of New York's most highly praised character actresses. She had sacrificed her career to care for an ailing parent, and when she returned to acting, she was in her mid-30s, overweight and without much promise of reviving her career. However, she scored great successes in the off-Broadway plays of Samuel Beckett (most notably \"Happy Days\"), appeared in Edward Albee's \"Malcolm\" (1966) and \"Box\" (1968), and earned a Tony nomination for her role in Harold Pinter's \"The Birthday Party\" (1968). She earned an Emmy nomination for her role in the Hallmark Hall of Fame production of \"Little Moon of Alban\".","birthday":"1914-04-24","deathday":"1969-12-03","id":8493,"imdb_id":"nm0925418","name":"Ruth White","place_of_birth":"Perth Amboy - New Jersey - USA","popularity":2.019,"profile_path":"/bsAHZQuh9XtWQoBalne2yTia7gt.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":5928,"title":"The Reivers","character":"Miss Reba","original_title":"The Reivers","poster_path":"/ujZFczURdyDvAvHeBAaSC2Q8I6Y.jpg","release_date":"1969-12-25","adult":false},{"id":42713,"title":"Up the Down Staircase","character":"Beatrice Schacter","original_title":"Up the Down Staircase","poster_path":"/qkPelPF6HteiI33nrj5s5QKasAk.jpg","release_date":"1967-01-19","adult":false},{"id":88583,"title":"The Pursuit of Happiness","character":"Mrs. Popper","original_title":"The Pursuit of Happiness","poster_path":"/nkbaX26s2J22ASkQWyDlNRyDZKZ.jpg","release_date":"1971-02-23","adult":false},{"id":621809,"title":"Lullaby","character":"Mother","original_title":"Lullaby","poster_path":"/gtLKxX8TOhnhjzD37TeOz6WYtYT.jpg","release_date":"1960-01-18","adult":false},{"id":29146,"title":"Charly","character":"Mrs. Apple","original_title":"Charly","poster_path":"/uxGt80D4hxEEwGwdOJ5tdVvjXEC.jpg","release_date":"1968-09-23","adult":false},{"id":95548,"title":"Baby the Rain Must Fall","character":"Miss Clara","original_title":"Baby the Rain Must Fall","poster_path":"/4L4bfHEspQBhvkZXMHDOlC01WxV.jpg","release_date":"1965-01-12","adult":false},{"id":247924,"title":"The Tiger Makes Out","character":"Mrs. Edna Kelly","original_title":"The Tiger Makes Out","poster_path":"/bDMkt7pLEizWbkxSYJsdCtBdAEY.jpg","release_date":"1967-08-18","adult":false},{"id":676530,"title":"Summer Pavilion","character":"Belle Travers","original_title":"Summer Pavilion","release_date":"1955-05-02","adult":false},{"id":3116,"title":"午夜牛郎","character":"Sally Buck","original_title":"Midnight Cowboy","poster_path":"/f7YLzOxwWzeEdo7RhAlPSBTYa8.jpg","release_date":"1969-05-25","adult":false},{"id":4929,"title":"吊人索","character":"Madame Sophie","original_title":"Hang 'em High","poster_path":"/ejdsKe7osgsYT5WpYqAMSvmdMEx.jpg","release_date":"1968-07-31","adult":false},{"id":35129,"title":"Edge of the City","character":"Mrs. Nordmann","original_title":"Edge of the City","poster_path":"/2g0VDMqbvzAmDDrVzMUcI7ieOsE.jpg","release_date":"1957-01-04","adult":false},{"id":86302,"title":"A Lovely Way to Die","character":"Biddy, Cook","original_title":"A Lovely Way to Die","poster_path":"/mIqAnDC7trpobKuouwgG0yXafBh.jpg","release_date":"1968-07-12","adult":false},{"id":27029,"title":"修女传","character":"Mother Marcella","original_title":"The Nun's Story","poster_path":"/3NfjFEnVFi0WPIa9iZ7NPQme9VM.jpg","release_date":"1959-06-18","adult":false},{"id":595,"title":"杀死一只知更鸟","character":"Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose","original_title":"To Kill a Mockingbird","poster_path":"/ymbVkjMBqRFNJsxDUKXR27Kqsxa.jpg","release_date":"1962-12-25","adult":false},{"id":42633,"title":"No Way to Treat a Lady","character":"Mrs. Himmel","original_title":"No Way to Treat a Lady","poster_path":"/mJfOfaaSGoCkoP87nMTMQysC4z0.jpg","release_date":"1968-03-20","adult":false},{"id":104759,"title":"A Rage to Live","character":"Mrs. Bannon","original_title":"A Rage to Live","release_date":"1965-10-20","adult":false},{"id":8737,"title":"黑幕落下","character":"Mrs. Chaison","original_title":"Cast a Giant Shadow","poster_path":"/fsjOjetKC0MtukxtahgrUjuAA27.jpg","release_date":"1966-03-30","adult":false}],"crew":[]},"images":{"profiles":[{"file_path":"/bsAHZQuh9XtWQoBalne2yTia7gt.jpg","width":616,"height":924,"aspect_ratio":0.66666666666667,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"nm0925418","freebase_mid":"/m/0406cwn","tvrage_id":4450}}
