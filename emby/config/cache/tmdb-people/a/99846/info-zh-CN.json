{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nSho Kosugi (born Shōichi Kosugi; June 17, 1947) is a Japanese martial artist with training in shindō jinen-ryū karate who gained popularity as an actor during the 1980s, usually playing a ninja. He is the father of Kane Kosugi and Shane Kosugi. After taking a hiatus from film, he started a taiko group in California. In Japan, he also runs an internationally oriented group of martial arts acting schools known as the Sho Kosugi Institute.\n\nIt is common for Kosugi to have his sons co-star in movies when the plot includes family relations. Films in which Kosugi's sons perform alongside their father include Black Eagle, Revenge of the Ninja, and Kabuto (aka Shogun Warrior).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Sho Kosugi, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia. ​","birthday":"1948-06-17","id":99846,"imdb_id":"nm0467563","name":"Sho Kosugi","place_of_birth":"Minato, Tokyo, Japan","popularity":3.293,"profile_path":"/cdoP2qnJILJlWT4xvYDxg2doaf6.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":28148,"title":"Ninja III: The Domination","character":"Yamada","original_title":"Ninja III: The Domination","poster_path":"/3zMY3oGopsx0o2HfSR4AZoShAhU.jpg","release_date":"1984-09-14","adult":false},{"id":35106,"title":"Pray For Death","character":"Akira Saito","original_title":"Pray For Death","poster_path":"/h8lcXvFQqii1FmsWr9UbD82G8yG.jpg","release_date":"1985-01-11","adult":false},{"id":40789,"title":"Journey of Honor","character":"Daigoro Mayeda","original_title":"Journey of Honor","poster_path":"/uEQwAigG53GBlKY19GB2RQ8lY1I.jpg","release_date":"1991-04-27","adult":false},{"id":17282,"title":"Rage of Honor","character":"Shiro Tanka","original_title":"Rage of Honor","poster_path":"/j5oRakY1PoEd4c56LtpyuBVek5e.jpg","release_date":"1987-02-01","adult":false},{"id":17386,"title":"Revenge of the Ninja","character":"Cho Osaki","original_title":"Revenge of the Ninja","poster_path":"/qEZ0Av3VvJvIs0zeqntNVUY9n48.jpg","release_date":"1983-09-07","adult":false},{"id":18214,"title":"Black Eagle","character":"Ken Tani","original_title":"Black Eagle","poster_path":"/wFkUkEluBdcldY0K7AMAQbz9d4p.jpg","release_date":"1988-05-01","adult":false},{"id":51878,"title":"9 Deaths of the Ninja","character":"Spike Shinobi","original_title":"9 Deaths of the Ninja","poster_path":"/2JRio8nhdkqzerHP8O0uhBXyV7m.jpg","release_date":"1985-04-15","adult":false},{"id":348658,"title":"The Master Ninja 5","character":"Okasa","original_title":"The Master Ninja 5","release_date":"1985-01-01","adult":false},{"id":17205,"title":"忍者潜入","character":"Hasegawa","original_title":"Enter the Ninja","poster_path":"/qm7cccLrUISl0QswgK2be9z31yC.jpg","release_date":"1981-07-17","adult":false},{"id":639413,"title":"Master Ninja","character":"Okasa","original_title":"Master Ninja","poster_path":"/vibIJNVLni98O10P2UofYE5pyrA.jpg","release_date":"1984-03-08","adult":false},{"id":54840,"title":"아메리카 방문객","character":"Suzuki (uncredited)","original_title":"아메리카 방문객","poster_path":"/4xbFd6egaggwKvWmic0SkTXXLgf.jpg","release_date":"1976-06-12","adult":false},{"id":22832,"title":"忍者刺客","character":"Ozunu","original_title":"Ninja Assassin","poster_path":"/9oroXB5BycZoSSRjwNIHggdEP4.jpg","release_date":"2009-09-29","adult":false},{"id":238748,"title":"Aloha Summer","character":"Yukinaga Konishi","original_title":"Aloha Summer","poster_path":"/8yj3MRkGZsvJ4NOOVCcgI7Cn5o7.jpg","release_date":"1988-02-26","adult":false},{"id":66946,"title":"The Bad News Bears Go to Japan","character":"Kata Demonstrator","original_title":"The Bad News Bears Go to Japan","poster_path":"/aG1FyJYM2aInTaQ6hBHsHtYqxI0.jpg","release_date":"1978-06-30","adult":false},{"id":19124,"title":"铁鹰战士","character":"The Assassin","original_title":"Blind Fury","poster_path":"/5jeOfvBFpRmsw4xEfmNlqJ2oukT.jpg","release_date":"1989-08-17","adult":false},{"id":356568,"title":"The Best of Martial Arts Films","character":"Himself","original_title":"The Best of Martial Arts Films","poster_path":"/hDeCk47CD5N7f1LyrDkyUde1opO.jpg","release_date":"1990-01-01","adult":false},{"id":435184,"title":"極東黒社会 DRUG CONNECTION","character":"","original_title":"極東黒社会 DRUG CONNECTION","release_date":"1993-05-15","adult":false},{"id":240,"title":"教父2","character":"Passerby in Coat with Cap Pulled Down","original_title":"The Godfather: Part II","poster_path":"/amvmeQWheahG3StKwIE1f7jRnkZ.jpg","release_date":"1974-12-20","adult":false}],"crew":[{"id":40789,"title":"Journey of Honor","original_title":"Journey of Honor","department":"Writing","job":"Writer","poster_path":"/uEQwAigG53GBlKY19GB2RQ8lY1I.jpg","release_date":"1991-04-27","adult":false}]},"images":{"profiles":[{"file_path":"/cdoP2qnJILJlWT4xvYDxg2doaf6.jpg","width":500,"height":750,"aspect_ratio":0.66666666666667,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"nm0467563","freebase_mid":"/m/09lr9c","freebase_id":"/en/sho_kosugi","tvrage_id":47578}}
