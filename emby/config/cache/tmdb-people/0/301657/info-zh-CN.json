{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"Colin Higgins was a British actor famous for many appearances on British television. In 1977 Higgins was cast as Wedge Antilles in Star Wars and appears in the role for one scene only. The reason for this is that Higgins was fired after a day of filming because he was having difficulty recalling his lines. He was replaced by Dennis Lawson, who went on to have great success in the role, whilst Higgins' performance went uncredited as 'Rebel Pilot'. For many years he was known by fans as 'Fake Wedge' until a retcon finally gave his character a unique name and backstory, that of Colonel Takbright. He died in December, 2012.","deathday":"2012-01-01","id":301657,"imdb_id":"nm0383360","name":"Colin Higgins","popularity":1.532,"profile_path":"/sF69BpL26VOAnYeLbr9RDvpAnW8.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":331237,"title":"Blooming Youth","character":"","original_title":"Blooming Youth","release_date":"1973-06-18","adult":false},{"id":40950,"title":"The Naked Civil Servant","character":"Thumbnails","original_title":"The Naked Civil Servant","poster_path":"/bdKnysyR5WLkbr335Uti8FF9OJQ.jpg","release_date":"1975-12-17","adult":false},{"id":270081,"title":"Diane","character":"","original_title":"Diane","release_date":"1975-07-09","adult":false},{"id":48131,"title":"The Shout","character":"","original_title":"The Shout","poster_path":"/bLITKNwcjux5UftI42jpV6ET1Dq.jpg","release_date":"1978-06-16","adult":false},{"id":13885,"title":"理发师陶德","character":"Elixir Sniffing Customer","original_title":"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street","poster_path":"/gAW4J1bkRjZKmFsJsIiOBASeoAp.jpg","release_date":"2007-01-25","adult":false},{"id":123163,"title":"That Summer","character":"Probation Officer","original_title":"That Summer","release_date":"1979-07-06","adult":false},{"id":32054,"title":"希望与荣耀","character":"Clive's Pal","original_title":"Hope and Glory","poster_path":"/3ri4tKjqnUrwVeuzfeNXmqiOfJ3.jpg","release_date":"1987-08-01","adult":false},{"id":149477,"title":"The Zany Adventures of Robin Hood","character":"Irving","original_title":"The Zany Adventures of Robin Hood","poster_path":"/3RKHf3yfQ3X8AcZTqSexWnU9n8l.jpg","release_date":"1984-05-22","adult":false},{"id":11,"title":"星球大战4：新希望","character":"Rebel Pilot, Col.
