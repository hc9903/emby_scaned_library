He has appeared in over 30 feature films including: The Reagans opposite Judy Davis, Battlefield Earth opposite John Travolta, and Gleason opposite Brad Garrett.  His performances in The Human Stain opposite Gary Sinise, and Taking Lives, opposite Angelina Jolie, were thoroughly enjoyed by all who rummaged around the cutting room floor.  As a founding member of Montreal’s On the Spot, Robert has been performing improv for well over a decade.

As a director, he has received a Gemini nomination for his work on the CBC series Edible Incredible, as well as a Canadian Comedy Award nomination for his work on Radio Active.

And of course, he continues to make his own films which have won him best short in the Actra shorts festival two years in a row, and best film in ASM’s 48 Hour Film Festival, 3 out of the 6 times he has entered.
