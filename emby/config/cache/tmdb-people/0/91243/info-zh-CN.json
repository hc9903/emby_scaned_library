The fourth of five children to Italian parents. After high school, he worked different jobs, one being construction work on high-rise buildings in Manhattan. He married, at a young age, his childhood girlfriend, Marie. He had a son after one year of marriage and decided he didn't want to work in construction, anymore. So, he headed west to try his luck in the movie business!\n\nHis brother, Paul Picerni, was an actor on a hit TV show at that time called \"The Untouchables (1959)\". Charlie worked as a stand-in, an extra and started doing stunt double work. Charlie immediately fell in love with this work and moved his family to California. Charlie excelled as a stuntman and then moved up to stunt-coordinating TV shows. He got his big break on \"Starsky and Hutch (1975)\", he was the stunt coordinator and Paul Michael Glaser's stunt double. Aaron Spelling and Duke Vincent saw what direction Charlie was heading in - Directing\"!\n\nHe started second unit-directing \"Starsky and Hutch (1975)\" and then moved up to directing episodes of \"Starsky\".
