She attended Boston College as a Musical Theater major, and left to move back home to New York to try acting professionally. Bonnie sang in many bands in the NYC music scene, and had a development deal to sing her own music at 17 years old. She was noticed by a modeling scout while waiting tables in NYC, and did some modeling in New York, and Europe, only to return more focused on acting. She packed her bags and moved to Los Angeles at age 22, very quickly had a band and then an agent. One of her first auditions, after getting an agent, was for the lead role in CBS's mini-series, Amours et rock'n' roll (1999), in which she also sang. She now lives in Los Angeles.  - IMDb Mini Biography By: Mel Mckeon","birthday":"1974-02-24","id":66579,"imdb_id":"nm0813887","name":"Bonnie Somerville","place_of_birth":"Brooklyn - New York - USA","popularity":2.024,"profile_path":"/kG8YzQmYJA7cy4i09AlKMksiet4.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":82099,"title":"A Holiday Engagement","character":"Hillary Burns","original_title":"A Holiday Engagement","poster_path":"/AvLCJSkH5rET9U92khCKq7O9Pys.jpg","release_date":"2011-11-28","adult":false},{"id":372740,"title":"Shake, Rattle and Roll: An American Love Story","character":"Lyne Danner","original_title":"Shake, Rattle and Roll: An American Love Story","poster_path":"/AfHeigDEyU0hCjqolzN5B1CdLyS.jpg","release_date":"1999-11-07","adult":false},{"id":59419,"title":"The Best and the Brightest","character":"Samantha","original_title":"The Best and the Brightest","poster_path":"/2DMVV9lFruRPCFIljehT4ufqZ1Y.jpg","release_date":"2010-01-01","adult":false},{"id":279332,"title":"Mom's Day Away","character":"Laura Miller","original_title":"Mom's Day Away","poster_path":"/vsoO3wRjjtCHMTFrJEdrtPnIOoM.jpg","release_date":"2014-05-11","adult":false},{"id":20085,"title":"Wedding Wars","character":"Maggie Welling","original_title":"Wedding Wars","poster_path":"/nD3AQBMWUcYlCHSsllb10r0WNLy.jpg","release_date":"2006-12-11","adult":false},{"id":355737,"title":"Pearly Gates","character":"Sharon","original_title":"Pearly Gates","poster_path":"/vsiybjzrQB7EFkp5fGZP00k1ujh.jpg","release_date":"2015-04-26","adult":false},{"id":421624,"title":"Love You Like Christmas","character":"Maddie Duncan","original_title":"Love You Like Christmas","poster_path":"/bBQPYILQUHMPI7TCEWlpXbxJNkN.jpg","release_date":"2016-12-11","adult":false},{"id":84577,"title":"七个以下","character":"Brooklyn","original_title":"7 Below","poster_path":"/5LibqJbTNF6xlcc0dMX6n5tHELn.jpg","release_date":"2012-04-16","adult":false},{"id":79519,"title":"Shades of Ray","character":"Noel Wilson","original_title":"Shades of Ray","poster_path":"/1grSWwgARYV9ypa9yRbio7e0U1R.jpg","release_date":"2008-10-18","adult":false},{"id":202225,"title":"Band from TV: Hoggin' All the Covers","character":"herself","original_title":"Band from TV: Hoggin' All the Covers","release_date":"2008-10-28","adult":false},{"id":19794,"title":"产前阵痛","character":"Suzie Cavandish","original_title":"Labor Pains","poster_path":"/7HktuUSx1DtJWTx0Z531Nf8Nn5i.jpg","release_date":"2009-07-19","adult":false},{"id":10762,"title":"寻宝假期","character":"Denise","original_title":"Without a Paddle","poster_path":"/xKzeJSBOMfPLtE5fzviroW4qIPo.jpg","release_date":"2004-08-20","adult":false},{"id":73677,"title":"Sleep Easy, Hutch Rimes","character":"Julie Proudfit","original_title":"Sleep Easy, Hutch Rimes","release_date":"2000-11-05","adult":false},{"id":20943,"title":"丑陋的真相","character":"Elizabeth","original_title":"The Ugly Truth","poster_path":"/2rq96Ihbqb1eU3TEBVtgFlqbeX7.jpg","release_date":"2009-07-24","adult":false},{"id":46119,"title":"Crime + Punishment in Suburbia","character":"Stuck Up Girl","original_title":"Crime + Punishment in Suburbia","poster_path":"/gA6FiAOm8De8v0RFOrdUPn9mgXX.jpg","release_date":"2000-08-25","adult":false},{"id":139567,"title":"以火攻火","character":"Karen Westlake","original_title":"Fire with Fire","poster_path":"/kziBJGQFo9f0Vkj9s37qI0G9I0I.jpg","release_date":"2012-08-31","adult":false},{"id":241254,"title":"王子","character":"Susan","original_title":"The Prince","poster_path":"/modzOgRl5gsX2zykFTXsTlP3x2W.jpg","release_date":"2014-08-22","adult":false},{"id":142308,"title":"圣诞狗狗之圣诞小宝贝","character":"Mrs. Paws (voice)","original_title":"Santa Paws 2: The Santa Pups","poster_path":"/6gIy6vKkEJFWA0I38kGbyPj1LY7.jpg","release_date":"2012-11-20","adult":false},{"id":78047,"title":"神犬也疯狂：护宝巴迪","character":"Mala (voice)","original_title":"Treasure Buddies","poster_path":"/8OZ7XFfZqN9tUWX4S6jNoZ2InUw.jpg","release_date":"2012-01-31","adult":false},{"id":48844,"title":"圣诞狗狗1：全面搜寻","character":"Kate Hucklebuckle","original_title":"The Search for Santa Paws","poster_path":"/rW6rXvT6AeNC4AUBC2HJiiLpwly.jpg","release_date":"2010-10-12","adult":false},{"id":558,"title":"蜘蛛侠2","character":"Screaming Woman (uncredited)","original_title":"Spider-Man 2","poster_path":"/vmBcuouNUirFTLkAlLL5kpmTr8U.jpg","release_date":"2004-06-25","adult":false}],"crew":[]},"images":{"profiles":[{"file_path":"/kG8YzQmYJA7cy4i09AlKMksiet4.jpg","width":300,"height":450,"aspect_ratio":0.66666666666667,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"nm0813887","freebase_mid":"/m/074bl8","freebase_id":"/en/bonnie_somerville","tvrage_id":18716}}
