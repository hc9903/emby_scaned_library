{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Spike 'Goon' Milligan"],"biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nTerence Alan Patrick Seán \"Spike\" Milligan KBE (16 April 1918 – 27 February 2002) was a comedian, writer, musician, poet, playwright, soldier, and actor. Milligan's early life was spent in India, where he was born, but the majority of his working life was spent in the United Kingdom. He became an Irish citizen in 1962 after the British government declared him stateless. He was the co-creator, main writer and a principal cast member of The Goon Show, performing a range of roles including the popular Eccles.\n\nMilligan wrote and edited many books, including Puckoon and his seven-volume autobiographical account of his time serving during the Second World War, beginning with Adolf Hitler: My part in his downfall. He is also noted as a popular writer of comical verse, much of his poetry was written for children, including Silly Verse for Kids (1959). After success with the ground-breaking British radio programme, The Goon Show, Milligan translated this success to television with Q5, a surreal sketch show which is credited as a major influence on the members of Monty Python's Flying Circus.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Spike Milligan,licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","birthday":"1918-04-16","deathday":"2002-02-27","id":29539,"imdb_id":"nm0589711","name":"Spike Milligan","place_of_birth":"Ahmed Nagar, India","popularity":1.712,"profile_path":"/jnJjdXDPJaGWm7BSsTphqc48EoJ.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":78185,"title":"The Great McGonagall","character":"William Topaz McGonagall","original_title":"The Great McGonagall","release_date":"1975-08-15","adult":false},{"id":158049,"title":"Postman's Knock","character":"Harold Petts","original_title":"Postman's Knock","poster_path":"/zCsdNVz4ciqVGroZBrxhYsb4Msp.jpg","release_date":"1962-03-01","adult":false},{"id":231215,"title":"Moonshadow","character":"Narrator","original_title":"Moonshadow","release_date":"1977-05-27","adult":false},{"id":226124,"title":"The Magnificent Seven Deadly Sins","character":"Tramp (segment \"Sloth\")","original_title":"The Magnificent Seven Deadly Sins","poster_path":"/k84g5vBw8IkQRUqIky2hYiSHVeu.jpg","release_date":"1971-11-01","adult":false},{"id":622022,"title":"Spike","character":"Himself","original_title":"Spike","poster_path":"/f9BO5PgM3XvlcP3kyoAtWn88FwF.jpg","release_date":"1996-06-11","adult":false},{"id":24912,"title":"The Case of the Mukkinese Battle-Horn","character":"Assorted","original_title":"The Case of the Mukkinese Battle-Horn","release_date":"1956-01-01","adult":false},{"id":35793,"title":"Penny Points to Paradise","character":"Spike Donnelly","original_title":"Penny Points to Paradise","poster_path":"/ngBfpzxRjFjy3A9k9eb4alYmaKD.jpg","release_date":"1951-01-01","adult":false},{"id":18188,"title":"Digby, the Biggest Dog in the World","character":"Dr. Harz","original_title":"Digby, the Biggest Dog in the World","poster_path":"/octObGSw4okoQZvvTrq4L1FZfZK.jpg","release_date":"1973-12-01","adult":false},{"id":54470,"title":"Let's Go Crazy","character":"Multiple Roles","original_title":"Let's Go Crazy","poster_path":"/oPbQmDYWjuzYFf8dzgQYucZg9vH.jpg","release_date":"1951-05-01","adult":false},{"id":97103,"title":"Down Among the Z Men","character":"Pvt.
