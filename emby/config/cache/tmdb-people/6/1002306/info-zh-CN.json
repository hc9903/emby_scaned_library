Steinberg","Robert Martin Steinberg","Robert Steinberg"],"biography":"Rob Steinberg was born in Philadelphia and partied at Tulane University in New Orleans where he actually graduated at the top of his class creating the university's first self-designed major in Communications. Rob spent the 80s in New York in \"the music biz\" -- and for what he can remember was involved in marketing, promotion, and management with such noted acts as Scorpions, War and Bob Marley. Rob switched careers and coasts after a near-fatal car accident, moved to Los Angeles and embarked on a second career, focusing his sites on the film business -- a decision his mom blames on the head injury from that car accident!","birthday":"1959-04-26","id":1002306,"imdb_id":"nm0825805","name":"Rob Steinberg","place_of_birth":" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","popularity":1.4,"credits":{"cast":[{"id":688754,"title":"12 Years a Slave: The Team","character":"Himself","original_title":"12 Years a Slave: The Team","poster_path":"/wzfP2J5pERXfegQECMgKuD0UAzJ.jpg","release_date":"2014-03-04","adult":false},{"id":306669,"title":"The Lovemaster","character":"Steiny","original_title":"The Lovemaster","release_date":"1997-10-03","adult":false},{"id":36930,"title":"Staying on Top","character":"Locke","original_title":"Staying on Top","poster_path":"/fsL2aZR9JJUZU2B03ZpPw7wd7Yu.jpg","release_date":"2002-01-01","adult":false},{"id":9605,"title":"叠影狂花","character":"Hedy's Date","original_title":"Single White Female","poster_path":"/2B6spN9XvzbK9hKDQtvTa4wVoys.jpg","release_date":"1992-08-14","adult":false},{"id":91534,"title":"Fatal Instinct","character":"Deputy D.A","original_title":"Fatal Instinct","poster_path":"/6kCXwJi0FLNZaZyA7AEqSj8Zg7R.jpg","release_date":"1992-09-09","adult":false},{"id":67630,"title":"Bikini Squad","character":"Fred","original_title":"Bikini Squad","poster_path":"/uoVsPSmQAFcaNuQlo8Vyh1D5xhG.jpg","release_date":"1993-01-01","adult":false},{"id":119117,"title":"劫机惊魂","character":"Mike Meltzer","original_title":"Hijacked","poster_path":"/nj4qD3Li9ZBw1W8vhF1n2WJvzIR.jpg","release_date":"2012-07-31","adult":false},{"id":283601,"title":"加尔维斯顿","character":"Snowbarger","original_title":"Galveston","poster_path":"/u3hDPc70JEWbrLruk6sni1OcODe.jpg","release_date":"2018-10-10","adult":false},{"id":123109,"title":"无人生还","character":"Dad","original_title":"No One Lives","poster_path":"/d9wDmRcQngl9Jo7Go3EU7f2W15m.jpg","release_date":"2013-03-09","adult":false},{"id":150405,"title":"Cover Me","character":"Logan Collins","original_title":"Cover Me","poster_path":"/3lsh83PLoyEUFZMWnyEjfihI9ZI.jpg","release_date":"1995-10-09","adult":false},{"id":296524,"title":"深海浩劫","character":"BP Rep","original_title":"Deepwater Horizon","poster_path":"/4tDn6OeOKJzETGL1CZkzugcBnzD.jpg","release_date":"2016-09-29","adult":false},{"id":326425,"title":"终极救援","character":"Ivan","original_title":"Extraction","poster_path":"/wrZawf8U5K0wZS4XjBSgUbdQc8S.jpg","release_date":"2015-12-18","adult":false},{"id":225703,"title":"The Starving Games","character":"Gandalf","original_title":"The Starving Games","poster_path":"/lrj2BCMUKjIK6yvX24lnuBT5yMc.jpg","release_date":"2013-11-07","adult":false},{"id":17494,"title":"危险第三情","character":"Deputy D.A","original_title":"Unlawful Entry","poster_path":"/sKUk1ca6gHaIopi8VqE8GoxJq6J.jpg","release_date":"1992-06-26","adult":false},{"id":14484,"title":"Body Shots","character":"Michael's Attorney (uncredited)","original_title":"Body Shots","poster_path":"/1YihuAszdbPMPxK7k46UYLdP1mz.jpg","release_date":"1999-10-07","adult":false},{"id":76203,"title":"为奴十二年","character":"Parker","original_title":"12 Years a Slave","poster_path":"/xdANQijuNrJaw1HA61rDccME4Tm.jpg","release_date":"2013-10-18","adult":false},{"id":1573,"title":"虎胆龙威2","character":"Victor (WZDC)","original_title":"Die Hard 2","poster_path":"/ybki0UWO3OPhaM6MSniuKC7sy1R.jpg","release_date":"1990-07-02","adult":false}],"crew":[]},"images":{"profiles":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"nm0825805","tvrage_id":0}}
