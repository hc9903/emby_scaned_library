{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[" Adrienne d'Ambricourt ","Adrienne DuNontier"],"biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nAdrienne D'Ambricourt (born Adrienne DuNontier; 2 June 1878 – 6 December 1957) was a French actress of the silent and sound film eras. She was born in Paris, and emigrated to the United States after the end of World War I.\n\nShe began acting in the 1922 Gershwin Broadway musical comedy, The French Doll, in which she had one of the main roles, \"Baroness Mazulier\". She made her film debut in the 1924 silent film, The Humming Bird, where she was one of Gloria Swanson's gang of thieves who turned into resistance fighters in World War I.\n\nWith the advent of talking pictures, and before dubbing came into general use, D'Ambricourt was used in several films which were the French version of English language ones, such as Quand on est belle (The Easiest Way — 1931), L'énigmatique Mr. Parkes (Slightly Scarlet — 1930), and Nuit d'Espagne (Transgression — 1931).\n\nShe appeared in over 70 films, including such classics as Casablanca, San Francisco, and To Have And Have Not, until about 1947, after which her film career began to decline. Her final role was in George Cukor's Les Girls, starring Gene Kelly and Mitzi Gaynor, in which she played the wardrobe woman. With the advent of television, she appeared in several series during the 1950s, working right up to her death, which was caused by a heart attack during or following a car accident in Los Angeles.","birthday":"1878-06-02","deathday":"1957-12-06","id":120778,"imdb_id":"nm0195077","name":"Adrienne D'Ambricourt","place_of_birth":"Paris, France","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/sxdn2lHpX17JNnnIbHpXXpADqyd.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":323103,"title":"The Bad One","character":"Madame Pompier","original_title":"The Bad One","release_date":"1930-05-03","adult":false},{"id":266272,"title":"Men in Her Life","character":"Maria","original_title":"Men in Her Life","poster_path":"/eM14QeVxEovnBl8lETeIxyLFpG.jpg","release_date":"1931-12-10","adult":false},{"id":120540,"title":"The Trial Of Mary Dugan","character":"Marie Ducrot","original_title":"The Trial Of Mary Dugan","release_date":"1929-06-08","adult":false},{"id":429535,"title":"Footlights and Fools","character":"Jo","original_title":"Footlights and Fools","poster_path":"/5C5ysAtrT5N1Smi0U90aGhHUQDS.jpg","release_date":"1929-12-08","adult":false},{"id":545169,"title":"The Humming Bird","character":"The Owl","original_title":"The Humming Bird","poster_path":"/sc7nRzDFglS9hZerP9sIPLGPEGD.jpg","release_date":"1924-01-13","adult":false},{"id":199030,"title":"This Modern Age","character":"Marie the Housekeeper","original_title":"This Modern Age","poster_path":"/m2Vsp9h2GExjxwBwtYjzz5pUQ0o.jpg","release_date":"1931-08-29","adult":false},{"id":109661,"title":"Transgression","character":"Julie, Elsie's French Maid","original_title":"Transgression","poster_path":"/5R8roPkkEB0jt18WYyePJhCBtmn.jpg","release_date":"1931-06-27","adult":false},{"id":294454,"title":"Disgraced!","character":"Madame Maxime","original_title":"Disgraced!","release_date":"1933-07-07","adult":false},{"id":147321,"title":"Gallant Lady","character":"Nanette - Deedy's Nurse (uncredited)","original_title":"Gallant Lady","release_date":"1933-12-07","adult":false},{"id":320287,"title":"War Mamas","character":"Countess's Maid (uncredited)","original_title":"War Mamas","poster_path":"/aHTsLeE2eRv2REwjAacV0ohPBu4.jpg","release_date":"1931-11-14","adult":false},{"id":78699,"title":"The Song of Songs","character":"French Teacher","original_title":"The Song of Songs","poster_path":"/iLyw73VDfTuvBlqPJBhGDVmPMNb.jpg","release_date":"1933-07-19","adult":false},{"id":261448,"title":"Scotland Yard","character":"Madame Rousseau, Innkeeper","original_title":"Scotland Yard","release_date":"1930-10-19","adult":false},{"id":97482,"title":"The Cat and the Fiddle","character":"Concierge","original_title":"The Cat and the Fiddle","poster_path":"/nIHZPXBbMuofjG1rTbWo1aPA3hs.jpg","release_date":"1934-02-16","adult":false},{"id":467892,"title":"What a Widow!","character":"Paulette","original_title":"What a Widow!","poster_path":"/gPBPhPZpRQlKMoRMIqcZEadvHkB.jpg","release_date":"1930-09-12","adult":false},{"id":31903,"title":"History Is Made at Night","character":"French Woman (uncredited)","original_title":"History Is Made at Night","poster_path":"/m0dqfRWkHVGEbmd72lTsG9vzi6H.jpg","release_date":"1937-03-05","adult":false},{"id":96709,"title":"The Secret of Madame Blanche","character":"Marie (Uncredited)","original_title":"The Secret of Madame Blanche","poster_path":"/zkIJGR6RSgJmEfRf9TESkcvcsYW.jpg","release_date":"1933-02-03","adult":false},{"id":184075,"title":"Mama Steps Out","character":"Jeanne","original_title":"Mama Steps Out","release_date":"1937-02-05","adult":false},{"id":246518,"title":"Artists and Models Abroad","character":"Madame Brissard","original_title":"Artists and Models Abroad","release_date":"1938-12-20","adult":false},{"id":140470,"title":"Bulldog Drummond's Bride","character":"Therese","original_title":"Bulldog Drummond's Bride","poster_path":"/pGzncKTrRAGqUzsTlv2Be8BY6GI.jpg","release_date":"1939-07-12","adult":false},{"id":349838,"title":"Bal Tabarin","character":"Madame Ramquet","original_title":"Bal Tabarin","release_date":"1952-05-31","adult":false},{"id":81110,"title":"The Eagle and the Hawk","character":"Fifi 'Fanny'","original_title":"The Eagle and the Hawk","poster_path":"/ex2K1jWIuQrxooQdHAj9OxHOH3P.jpg","release_date":"1933-05-06","adult":false},{"id":180453,"title":"Marie Galante","character":"French Girl","original_title":"Marie Galante","poster_path":"/xbhHZFlvCohIIh78Wn0NMrcFM0B.jpg","release_date":"1934-10-25","adult":false},{"id":217162,"title":"Paris Underground","character":"Margot","original_title":"Paris Underground","poster_path":"/dOzNqo9aqPX3fkkOeC79wczNlUX.jpg","release_date":"1945-10-18","adult":false},{"id":221555,"title":"I Met My Love Again","character":"Marie","original_title":"I Met My Love Again","poster_path":"/s8bA28bryo8xaGZNrk4JxKpbpGA.jpg","release_date":"1938-01-14","adult":false},{"id":252453,"title":"Pack Up Your Troubles","character":"Mme.
