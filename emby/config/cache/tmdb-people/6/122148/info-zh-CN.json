{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nRobert Carroll Nye (October 4, 1901 – March 17, 1974) was an American film actor. He appeared in 58 films between 1925 and 1944.  His mother, Myra Nye, worked for the Los Angeles Times. Carroll was educated at the University of California and later became a reporter and radio editor with the Times like his mother. However, he went into film business in 1924. At the beginning of his career he had a score of leading man roles in Hollywood opposite such silent screen stars as Anita Page and Corinne Griffith. In his late career, he played usually small roles, perhaps most memorably as Frank Kennedy, Scarlett's second husband, in Gone with the Wind (1939). His film career ended in 1944 with an uncredited role in Wilson. Nye also worked with Groucho Marx at CBS.\n\nAfter his film career, Nye served as a Hollywood newscaster and publicity man. He was married to actress Helen Lynch since 1928, but the marriage ended in divorce. He later married a woman named Dorothy, mentioned on his gravestone at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills. His brother was respected Hollywood makeup artist Ben Nye.","birthday":"1901-10-04","deathday":"1974-03-17","id":122148,"imdb_id":"nm0638560","name":"Carroll Nye","place_of_birth":"Akron, Ohio, USA","popularity":0.6,"credits":{"cast":[{"id":190160,"title":"While the City Sleeps","character":"Marty","original_title":"While the City Sleeps","poster_path":"/iserUuzeb9HZyZyGrlDVwquy7di.jpg","release_date":"1928-02-15","adult":false},{"id":349095,"title":"Jazzland","character":"Homer Pew","original_title":"Jazzland","release_date":"1928-12-01","adult":false},{"id":468478,"title":"The Girl in the Glass Cage","character":"Terry Pomfret","original_title":"The Girl in the Glass Cage","poster_path":"/9OmWXR9nNrSGfNWw7hrk68y67b1.jpg","release_date":"1929-06-22","adult":false},{"id":625744,"title":"Her Honor, the Governor","character":"","original_title":"Her Honor, the Governor","release_date":"1926-07-19","adult":false},{"id":39075,"title":"Madame X","character":"Darrell, a Naval Officer","original_title":"Madame X","poster_path":"/nxzB6TdS2cb86uVkFjJMikFQ98W.jpg","release_date":"1929-08-17","adult":false},{"id":600312,"title":"The Sporting Age","character":"","original_title":"The Sporting Age","poster_path":"/fjqq4Lcdxet0zeXq96cXBDt93H0.jpg","release_date":"1928-03-02","adult":false},{"id":600470,"title":"The One Way Trail","character":"Terry Allen","original_title":"The One Way Trail","poster_path":"/4flSMt5puMsPDeIZH0EQaBKqjyX.jpg","release_date":"1931-10-15","adult":false},{"id":285329,"title":"Sons of the Saddle","character":"Harvey","original_title":"Sons of the Saddle","release_date":"1930-08-03","adult":false},{"id":286881,"title":"Craig's Wife","character":"John Fredericks","original_title":"Craig's Wife","release_date":"1928-09-16","adult":false},{"id":533892,"title":"The Girl from Chicago","character":"Bob Carlton","original_title":"The Girl from Chicago","poster_path":"/7ita4uu1nqfLRxlTCsE2tAWIp4n.jpg","release_date":"1927-11-09","adult":false},{"id":608240,"title":"Little Mickey Grogan","character":"","original_title":"Little Mickey Grogan","release_date":"1927-12-27","adult":false},{"id":169842,"title":"The Squall","character":"Paul","original_title":"The Squall","release_date":"1929-05-09","adult":false},{"id":595447,"title":"The Heart of Maryland","character":"","original_title":"The Heart of Maryland","poster_path":"/79noXXhdR3pADxGa6tqo0U7N1Dw.jpg","release_date":"1927-07-13","adult":false},{"id":281473,"title":"The Trail Blazers","character":"Jim Chapman","original_title":"The Trail Blazers","release_date":"1940-11-11","adult":false},{"id":166546,"title":"The Lottery Bride","character":"Nels","original_title":"The Lottery Bride","release_date":"1930-11-27","adult":false},{"id":61546,"title":"The Bishop Murder Case","character":"John E.
