He had a recurring role on the TV series Vega$, as Harlon Twoleaf and starred in the movies Fish Hawk, The Outlaw Josey Wales, and Orca.\n\nSampson appeared in the production of Black Elk Speaks with the American Indian Theater Company in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where David Carradine and other Native American actors like Wes Studi and Randolph Mantooth starred in stage productions.\n\nSampson competed in rodeos, his speciality riding bucking broncos, for about twenty years. He was on the rodeo circuit when the producers of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Saul Zaentz and Michael Douglas, were looking for a large Native American to play the role of Chief Bromden. A rodeo announcer told them about Sampson, and after lengthy efforts to find him, they hired him on the strength of an interview. He had never acted before.\n\nSampson was also an artist. His large painting depicting the Ribbon Dance of his Muscogee people is in the collection of the Creek Council House Museum in Okmulgee, Oklahoma. His artwork is currently displayed online by The Kvskvnv (“kuskuna”) Association.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Will Sampson, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","birthday":"1933-09-27","deathday":"1987-06-03","id":68301,"imdb_id":"nm0760225","name":"Will Sampson","place_of_birth":"Okmulgee, Oklahoma, USA","popularity":1.301,"profile_path":"/eTFrqcbAxcFzqmdEDR5PhIUKTNW.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":309401,"title":"Fish Hawk","character":"Fish Hawk","original_title":"Fish Hawk","release_date":"1980-01-25","adult":false},{"id":331079,"title":"Relentless","character":"Sam Watchman","original_title":"Relentless","release_date":"1977-09-14","adult":false},{"id":12707,"title":"Orca: The Killer Whale","character":"Umilak","original_title":"Orca: The Killer Whale","poster_path":"/77tRmkN3WBIARgxMhbQGMfixB5A.jpg","release_date":"1977-07-22","adult":false},{"id":47914,"title":"The White Buffalo","character":"Crazy Horse / Worm","original_title":"The White Buffalo","poster_path":"/zYRD9IGDxlvbIRqMJA1hgl7M14q.jpg","release_date":"1977-05-01","adult":false},{"id":326232,"title":"Standing Tall","character":"Lonny Moon","original_title":"Standing Tall","release_date":"1978-01-21","adult":false},{"id":12715,"title":"横行天下","character":"Tall Eagle","original_title":"Firewalker","poster_path":"/v8DC9qUY6KNF4tqYq7agbwFqR78.jpg","release_date":"1986-11-21","adult":false},{"id":325242,"title":"Alcatraz: The Whole Shocking Story","character":"Clarence's Father","original_title":"Alcatraz: The Whole Shocking Story","release_date":"1980-11-05","adult":false},{"id":42035,"title":"无足轻重","character":"Elevator Attendant","original_title":"Insignificance","poster_path":"/5lLtBOk4W7nia5Bvsekarm4vr3J.jpg","release_date":"1985-01-01","adult":false},{"id":358069,"title":"Roanoak","character":"Wingina","original_title":"Roanoak","release_date":"1986-05-26","adult":false},{"id":11133,"title":"鬼追魂","character":"Taylor","original_title":"Poltergeist II: The Other Side","poster_path":"/2r22KqmzWV48kF02GN78NaS3q0m.jpg","release_date":"1986-05-23","adult":false},{"id":670479,"title":"That's Insignificance","character":"","original_title":"That's Insignificance","release_date":"1984-12-31","adult":false},{"id":510,"title":"飞越疯人院","character":"Chief Bromden","original_title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","poster_path":"/yMgm27NWJsNblsE6Y0px7NtUBl8.jpg","release_date":"1975-11-18","adult":false},{"id":288617,"title":"The Mystic Warrior","character":"Wambli","original_title":"The Mystic Warrior","poster_path":"/kmrpAWngcYYQuv4zfwNPsDPgXyP.jpg","release_date":"1984-05-20","adult":false},{"id":331049,"title":"The Hunted Lady","character":"Uncle George","original_title":"The Hunted Lady","poster_path":"/pRG6ErzZGjz7ev692fwut6U9uru.jpg","release_date":"1977-11-28","adult":false},{"id":42233,"title":"西塞英雄谱","character":"The Interpreter (William Halsey)","original_title":"Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull's History Lesson","poster_path":"/fBhqMJybJgvnUoBBfj7vApAukvL.jpg","release_date":"1976-06-24","adult":false},{"id":10747,"title":"西部执法者","character":"Ten Bears","original_title":"The Outlaw Josey Wales","poster_path":"/92BZIFPbyCPNhExyFScxA3xF1dy.jpg","release_date":"1976-06-30","adult":false}],"crew":[]},"images":{"profiles":[{"file_path":"/eTFrqcbAxcFzqmdEDR5PhIUKTNW.jpg","width":640,"height":960,"aspect_ratio":0.66666666666667,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"nm0760225","freebase_mid":"/m/014y7t","freebase_id":"/en/will_sampson","tvrage_id":48717}}
