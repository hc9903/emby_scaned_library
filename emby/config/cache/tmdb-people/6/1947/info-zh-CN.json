{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"Stocky character actor Stanley Adams had a relatively minor career in  motion pictures, with the possible exception of his baby-faced  millionaire Rusty Trawler of Breakfast at Tiffany's  (1961) fame. Otherwise, he played innumerable minor ethnic villains,  bartenders and avuncular, fast-talking characters, known in the credits  only by their first names. In other words, most of his roles were rather  small. On television, conversely, he proved himself quite a  scene-stealer, particularly in the 1960's and early 70's, when his face  appeared on just about every major show. He was at his best as pool  hustler Sure-shot Wilson in an episode of The Odd Couple (1970), Rollo, a quirky time-traveling scientist on Twilight Zone (1959), and - famously - as 'asteroid detecting', tribble dealing galactic entrepreneur Cyrano Jones on Star Trek (1966). Alas, he was also a space carrot named Tybo on Lost in Space (1965)....\n\nHis  suicide in April 1977 has been attributed to severe depression as a  result of a back injury, sustained earlier in the decade. Apart from the  obvious pain, it would almost certainly have limited his employment  opportunities.\n\nDate of Death  27 April  1977, Santa Monica, California
