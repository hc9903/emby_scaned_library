Much later in his career he appeared in several television series. The vast majority of his roles throughout the years were uncredited bit parts.\n\nMr. George's original name was Tufei Filhela; on his 1925 United States citizenship naturalization Declaration of Intention document, he signed his name \"Tufei Filhela known as John George\".
