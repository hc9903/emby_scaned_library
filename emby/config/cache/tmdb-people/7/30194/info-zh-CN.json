He was usually cast as a comic heavy, and often played policemen, doormen, prizefighters, or bullies.\n\nSandford was born in Osage, Iowa. After working in stock theater he began acting in movies around 1910. He appeared in The Gold Rush with Charlie Chaplin, who became one of his best friends. His Charlie Chaplin movies include The Circus (1928) and Modern Times (1936), where he plays \"Big Bill\". His films with Laurel and Hardy include Big Business (1929), Double Whoopee (1929), The Chimp (1932), and Our Relations (1936). Sandford also acted in Way Out West, but his sequence was cut from the final take.\n\nHe also appeared in dramas such as The World's Champion (1922) and The Iron Mask (1929).\n\nHe retired from acting in 1940, the year he had a very small role Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator.
