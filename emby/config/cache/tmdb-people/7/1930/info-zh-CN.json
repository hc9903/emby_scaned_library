{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nTruman Capote (September 30, 1924 – August 25, 1984) was an American author and comedian, many of whose short stories, novels, plays, and nonfiction are recognized literary classics, including the novella Breakfast at Tiffany's (1958) and true crime novel In Cold Blood (1966), which he labeled a \"nonfiction novel.\" At least 20 films and television dramas have been produced from Capote novels, stories and screenplays.\n\nCapote rose above a childhood troubled by divorce, a long absence from his mother and multiple migrations. He discovered his calling by the age of 11, and for the rest of his childhood he honed his writing ability. Capote began his professional career writing short stories. The critical success of one story, \"Miriam\" (1945), attracted the attention of Random House publisher Bennett Cerf, resulting in a contract to write Other Voices, Other Rooms (1948). Capote earned the most fame with In Cold Blood (1966), a journalistic work about the murder of a Kansas farm family in their home, a book Capote spent four years writing, with much help from Nelle Harper Lee, who wrote the famous To Kill a Mockingbird. A milestone in popular culture, it was the peak of his career, although it was not his final book. In the 1970s, he maintained his celebrity status by appearing on television talk shows.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Truman Capote, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.​","birthday":"1924-09-30","deathday":"1984-08-25","id":1930,"imdb_id":"nm0001986","name":"Truman Capote","place_of_birth":"New Orleans, Louisiana, USA","popularity":0.615,"profile_path":"/kmhddndt7hI38aN6NzbhPcnjKSh.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":6037,"title":"怪宴","character":"Lionel Twain","original_title":"Murder by Death","poster_path":"/tM0acFLrIDvcHw7u3br2Al5IcGz.jpg","release_date":"1976-06-23","adult":false},{"id":62952,"title":"A Christmas Memory","character":"Narrator","original_title":"A Christmas Memory","release_date":"1966-12-21","adult":false},{"id":298662,"title":"A Visit with Truman Capote","character":"Himself","original_title":"A Visit with Truman Capote","release_date":"1966-01-01","adult":false},{"id":300417,"title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","character":"Narrator","original_title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","poster_path":"/vr4Eoq3qjBZ4SVdjy9JehrJF0CF.jpg","release_date":"1967-11-01","adult":false},{"id":538695,"title":"Beaton by Bailey","character":"self","original_title":"Beaton by Bailey","release_date":"","adult":false},{"id":198781,"title":"Trilogy","character":"Narrator","original_title":"Trilogy","release_date":"1969-06-08","adult":false},{"id":35922,"title":"杂种布鲁斯","character":"Himself","original_title":"The Rolling Stones: Cocksucker Blues","poster_path":"/ohkYXuOmvMRg77ucUODcxeqAwCL.jpg","release_date":"1972-01-01","adult":false},{"id":703,"title":"安妮·霍尔","character":"Truman Capote Look-Alike (uncredited)","original_title":"Annie Hall","poster_path":"/dEtjPywhDbAXYjoFfhBC4U9unU7.jpg","release_date":"1977-04-19","adult":false}],"crew":[{"id":22733,"title":"战胜恶魔","original_title":"Beat the Devil","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay","poster_path":"/97B9N41lJUDarWSNYjyJsf6Ns6R.jpg","release_date":"1953-11-24","adult":false},{"id":16372,"title":"无罪的人","original_title":"The Innocents","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay","poster_path":"/1niUVi1tcmPqjloreUMw3LqOXGN.jpg","release_date":"1961-12-15","adult":false},{"id":46732,"title":"The Grass Harp","original_title":"The Grass Harp","department":"Writing","job":"Novel","poster_path":"/pcdi92LC26RW3zm97SwF3NXYTUr.jpg","release_date":"1995-09-10","adult":false},{"id":74585,"title":"Stazione Termini","original_title":"Stazione Termini","department":"Writing","job":"Dialogue","poster_path":"/pJViLTmh95OmwMo88QdUhI9hToC.jpg","release_date":"1953-04-04","adult":false},{"id":147135,"title":"One Christmas","original_title":"One Christmas","department":"Writing","job":"Story","poster_path":"/uTVZyFVVJ5WVjH1G08UxeKSv9tw.jpg","release_date":"1994-12-19","adult":false},{"id":206042,"title":"Children on Their Birthdays","original_title":"Children on Their Birthdays","department":"Writing","job":"Writer","poster_path":"/aNI0ibiymUc7kOyGfhP0ayR01Hc.jpg","release_date":"2002-02-16","adult":false},{"id":242920,"title":"The Glass House","original_title":"The Glass House","department":"Writing","job":"Writer","poster_path":"/btbMGXTs7VbdhJVXo3tI6fwpBql.jpg","release_date":"1972-02-04","adult":false},{"id":280412,"title":"Summer Crossing","original_title":"Summer Crossing","department":"Writing","job":"Novel","release_date":"","adult":false},{"id":121831,"title":"Love, Marilyn","original_title":"Love, Marilyn","department":"Writing","job":"Writer","poster_path":"/1YPp03izMP73O8AVqAk2acS0z1C.jpg","release_date":"2012-09-12","adult":false},{"id":198781,"title":"Trilogy","original_title":"Trilogy","department":"Writing","job":"Story","release_date":"1969-06-08","adult":false},{"id":62952,"title":"A Christmas Memory","original_title":"A Christmas Memory","department":"Writing","job":"Writer","release_date":"1966-12-21","adult":false},{"id":300417,"title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","original_title":"The Thanksgiving Visitor","department":"Writing","job":"Story","poster_path":"/vr4Eoq3qjBZ4SVdjy9JehrJF0CF.jpg","release_date":"1967-11-01","adult":false},{"id":18900,"title":"冷血","original_title":"In Cold Blood","department":"Writing","job":"Book","poster_path":"/hXRyR0kfB64aj2y76JBjRSRQYOw.jpg","release_date":"1967-12-14","adult":false},{"id":164,"title":"蒂凡尼的早餐","original_title":"Breakfast at Tiffany's","department":"Writing","job":"Novel","poster_path":"/2xpf0cwILMTLi5a95qmqk6lROOr.jpg","release_date":"1961-10-06","adult":false},{"id":64562,"title":"Other Voices Other Rooms","original_title":"Other Voices Other Rooms","department":"Writing","job":"Writer","poster_path":"/4ifPBA4AjRQWxgVJAwSwWp6nFCa.jpg","release_date":"1995-09-15","adult":false}]},"images":{"profiles":[{"file_path":"/kmhddndt7hI38aN6NzbhPcnjKSh.jpg","width":400,"height":600,"aspect_ratio":0.66666666666667,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"nm0001986","freebase_mid":"/m/014dq7","freebase_id":"/en/truman_capote","tvrage_id":4440}}
