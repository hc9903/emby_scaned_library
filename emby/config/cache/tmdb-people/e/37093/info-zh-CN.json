{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Langley Jack Kirkwood"],"biography":"His family moved to South Africa when Kirkwood was young. The son of a poet and an art teacher, he was exposed to literature and the arts from an early age and fell in love with acting in his school years. He studied drama at high school and at Johannesburg's Wits University, and started working in theatre immediately thereafter. He made an award-winning debut at Johannesburg's Market Theatre as Billy the Kid and followed that up by award-nominated performances in other theatre productions in both Johannesburg and Cape Town, and winning another award as Biff Loman in Miller's Death of a Salesman. He had two children, Willow and Phoenix with former Calvin Klein model Josie Borain. He lives in Cape Town and works primarily in film and television, but still finds time for theatre and also works as a voice-artist. He is a fitness fanatic and spends much of his free time trail running, cycling and competing in ultra distance races.","birthday":"1973-04-14","homepage":"http://langleykirkwood.com/","id":37093,"imdb_id":"nm0456810","name":"Langley Kirkwood","place_of_birth":"Bromley, Kent, England, UK","popularity":1.455,"profile_path":"/2Ev4ekSdyrdzfO4RStIfy8ArcsP.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":260063,"title":"第八海豹突击队：深入敌后","character":"Lt.Parker","original_title":"Seal Team Eight: Behind Enemy Lines","poster_path":"/qyZoKCgQYRMFmKtd84UzL5tNHJg.jpg","release_date":"2014-03-01","adult":false},{"id":83975,"title":"亚特兰蒂斯：世界的终结，传奇的诞生","character":"Rusa","original_title":"Atlantis: End of a World, Birth of a Legend","poster_path":"/kUeKPNHU3ESdStA1Oy2hGHbTPva.jpg","release_date":"2011-01-01","adult":false},{"id":233798,"title":"Dead Easy","character":"Lloyd","original_title":"Dead Easy","release_date":"2004-12-13","adult":false},{"id":498248,"title":"白狮奇缘","character":"John Owen","original_title":"Mia et le lion blanc","poster_path":"/lmrgXnG90DFZYeLrNhuEKUo7nKk.jpg","release_date":"2018-12-26","adult":false},{"id":16635,"title":"Country of My Skull","character":"Boetie","original_title":"Country of My Skull","poster_path":"/bkuOhlmJJnq6sZfY9WRKQVKRnnJ.jpg","release_date":"2004-05-04","adult":false},{"id":49049,"title":"新特警判官","character":"Judge Lex","original_title":"Dredd","poster_path":"/il3qjSh8idHZeWtsnQ21ZW0xKYL.jpg","release_date":"2012-09-07","adult":false},{"id":10838,"title":"Dracula 3000","character":"Orlock","original_title":"Dracula 3000","poster_path":"/vHClROtgcoHWiUUEmynGtlU15v6.jpg","release_date":"2004-08-09","adult":false},{"id":156717,"title":"死亡飞车3：地狱烈焰","character":"Dr. Klein","original_title":"Death Race: Inferno","poster_path":"/p7NEoMmv6fcMk4Hea3S7eIgssjH.jpg","release_date":"2013-01-04","adult":false},{"id":177203,"title":"The Challenger","character":"Avionics Engineer","original_title":"The Challenger","poster_path":"/r1KIuvAv2cpJwWp6CwHR3pz3Z7U.jpg","release_date":"2013-03-18","adult":false},{"id":341077,"title":"猛虎之家","character":"Sveta","original_title":"Tiger House","poster_path":"/hrZvEXy4f5zLI10dSxY9LQ1tCMq.jpg","release_date":"2015-08-24","adult":false},{"id":13722,"title":"Mercenary for Justice","character":"Kruger","original_title":"Mercenary for Justice","poster_path":"/7oV5BkxFv7jpLiwu8q2YEMr8uVa.jpg","release_date":"2006-04-25","adult":false},{"id":4407,"title":"The Three Investigators and The Secret Of Skeleton Island","character":"Tom Farraday","original_title":"The Three Investigators and The Secret Of Skeleton Island","poster_path":"/bjdTts4LL1yJCbHWHa52bwiGZbx.jpg","release_date":"2007-11-07","adult":false},{"id":221569,"title":"Felix","character":"Jeff Junior","original_title":"Felix","release_date":"2013-09-13","adult":false},{"id":22451,"title":"The Bone Snatcher","character":"Paul","original_title":"The Bone Snatcher","poster_path":"/kceAJpK27zaE2IdXU1iIzUHZcIt.jpg","release_date":"2003-12-23","adult":false},{"id":22954,"title":"成事在人","character":"George","original_title":"Invictus","poster_path":"/cNUoXM8dtg5mRt90GLrAHBP9IGE.jpg","release_date":"2009-12-10","adult":false},{"id":15210,"title":"Coronation Street: Out of Africa","character":"Ed Teal","original_title":"Coronation Street: Out of Africa","release_date":"2008-11-11","adult":false},{"id":689717,"title":"King Solomon’s Mines","character":"Sergei","original_title":"King Solomon’s Mines","poster_path":"/bZP6lrax4hZEJvMFTsAKLiIEwB2.jpg","release_date":"2004-01-09","adult":false},{"id":235260,"title":"上帝之子","character":"King David","original_title":"Son of God","poster_path":"/bCNcVQ1sts0WfuGzus90OYHTIlt.jpg","release_date":"2014-02-28","adult":false},{"id":266285,"title":"救世","character":"Man With Beard","original_title":"The Salvation","poster_path":"/oMS5EZkXRYTpq3yYI6iWNUZOCvS.jpg","release_date":"2014-05-22","adult":false}],"crew":[]},"images":{"profiles":[{"file_path":"/2Ev4ekSdyrdzfO4RStIfy8ArcsP.jpg","width":1067,"height":1600,"aspect_ratio":0.666875,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"nm0456810","freebase_mid":"/m/05kkf6d","freebase_id":"/en/langley_kirkwood","tvrage_id":61381}}
