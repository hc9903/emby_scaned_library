{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"​Shefali Chowdhury (born 20 June, 1988) is a Welsh actress originally from Denbigh, Wales. She was brought up in a Muslim family, along with five siblings, of whom she is the youngest. Shefali is of Bengali origin; her parents immigrated to England from Sylhet, Bangladesh in the 1980s, when many Bengalis migrated to the UK. She plays Harry Potter's Yule Ball date, Parvati Patil, in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Daniel Radcliffe, who plays Harry Potter in the film, spoke at the launch of Goblet of Fire in London and said, \"I had a dance scene with Shefali. She was completely gorgeous.\"  She also appeared in an uncredited role in a Tamil film Kannathil Muthamittal.  Shefali landed the coveted role of Parvati Patil whilst she was still a student in her final year at Waverley School in Birmingham. She did four A Levels, in English Language, Literature, Sociology, and Religious Studies at The Sixth Form College, Solihull. Her studies coincided with shooting of the current instalment of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, where she reprised her role as Parvati Patil.  Despite Parvati's relatively small role in the book, Chowdhury was able to reprise her role for film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.[1]. She did not, however, appear in either part of the adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.  She is currently studying Photography in Birmingham, UK.
