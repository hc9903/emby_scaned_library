Two years later she became Bing Crosby's second wife. The couple had three children, Harry, Mary Frances, and Nathaniel. She appeared as a guest star on her husband's 1964–1965 ABC sitcom The Bing Crosby Show.\n\nShe largely retired after their marriage, but did have a featured role in the courtroom drama Anatomy of a Murder. She also played the part of \"Mama Bear\" alongside her husband and children in Goldilocks and starred with Jack Lemmon in Operation Mad Ball in 1957.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, she hosted The Kathryn Crosby Show, a 30-minute local talk-show on KPIX-TV in San Francisco. Husband Bing appeared as a guest occasionally.\n\nSince Bing Crosby's death in 1977, she has taken on a few smaller roles and the lead in the short-lived 1996 Broadway musical State Fair.\n\nFor 16 years ending in 2001, Crosby hosted the Crosby National Golf Tournament at Bermuda Run Country Club in Bermuda Run, North Carolina. A nearby bridge carrying U.S. Route 158 over the Yadkin River is named for Crosby.\n\nOn November 4, 2010, Crosby was seriously injured in an automobile accident in the Sierra Nevada that killed her 85-year-old husband, Maurice William Sullivan.","birthday":"1933-11-25","id":861,"imdb_id":"nm0335497","name":"Kathryn Grant","place_of_birth":"Houston, Texas, USA","popularity":3.151,"profile_path":"/c739OZ40Czy0D3Q2fCj9npNmh8X.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":61701,"title":"The Night the World Exploded","character":"Laura 'Hutch' Hutchinson","original_title":"The Night the World Exploded","poster_path":"/fYUi3Ev4wFAxhnmIqi3Rt2XbIPo.jpg","release_date":"1957-06-14","adult":false},{"id":15515,"title":"辛巴达七航妖岛","character":"Princess Parisa","original_title":"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad","poster_path":"/mzEFF9YRN13HLz6Cq7jMYR8aHVb.jpg","release_date":"1958-12-05","adult":false},{"id":44871,"title":"1001 Arabian Nights","character":"Princess Yasminda (voice)","original_title":"1001 Arabian Nights","poster_path":"/mDCv4F7CtVWVOdlsKPcf4JpGwea.jpg","release_date":"1959-12-01","adult":false},{"id":71768,"title":"The Guns of Fort Petticoat","character":"Anne Martin","original_title":"The Guns of Fort Petticoat","poster_path":"/AqPmINIfSS2s0NNh8XpmoDcphs1.jpg","release_date":"1957-04-01","adult":false},{"id":35017,"title":"The Brothers Rico","character":"Norah Malaks Rico","original_title":"The Brothers Rico","poster_path":"/59aZ6GYYezrID4QLbhhU1RpFNGP.jpg","release_date":"1957-09-01","adult":false},{"id":35956,"title":"The Phenix City Story","character":"Ellie Rhodes","original_title":"The Phenix City Story","poster_path":"/9VB4tGVtym2qXodfxQsCAJBKkSO.jpg","release_date":"1955-07-19","adult":false},{"id":183532,"title":"Reprisal!","character":"Taini","original_title":"Reprisal!","poster_path":"/ivpirfBYffHWh17hTKoKKRlQ3IC.jpg","release_date":"1956-11-02","adult":false},{"id":42871,"title":"Gunman's Walk","character":"Cecily \"Clee\" Chouard","original_title":"Gunman's Walk","poster_path":"/mUGEWgmAeup5lh2tJ2f55nUYVSh.jpg","release_date":"1958-07-01","adult":false},{"id":403247,"title":"A Bing Crosby Christmas","character":"Herself","original_title":"A Bing Crosby Christmas","poster_path":"/3SqjXZboUNwSuyVETUXmPN1O38Q.jpg","release_date":"1998-01-01","adult":false},{"id":23692,"title":"The Initiation of Sarah","character":"Mrs. Goodwin","original_title":"The Initiation of Sarah","poster_path":"/kbKcra3xt8y7C64Qcs1Nfk2Pzjf.jpg","release_date":"1978-02-06","adult":false},{"id":33862,"title":"Cell 2455 Death Row","character":"Jo-Anne","original_title":"Cell 2455 Death Row","poster_path":"/fmf7cmGS90GtuVzGiF1kj2pMDuL.jpg","release_date":"1955-04-19","adult":false},{"id":47058,"title":"Queen of the Lot","character":"Elizabeth Lambert","original_title":"Queen of the Lot","release_date":"2013-11-20","adult":false},{"id":118990,"title":"Mister Cory","character":"Jen Vollard","original_title":"Mister Cory","poster_path":"/2XMiZebSjRPg74soAdQWLlzs1El.jpg","release_date":"1957-02-23","adult":false},{"id":119001,"title":"The Big Circus","character":"Jeannie Whirling","original_title":"The Big Circus","poster_path":"/zcOn90tELdfapHjLHRbGiEwWj7N.jpg","release_date":"1959-07-05","adult":false},{"id":118549,"title":"The Wild Party","character":"Honey","original_title":"The Wild Party","poster_path":"/osNHsUxGAwj949lS6tWS1hb6gvG.jpg","release_date":"1956-12-21","adult":false},{"id":93,"title":"桃色血案","character":"Mary Pilant","original_title":"Anatomy of a Murder","poster_path":"/lMWWs7IskGldLfwwnVxHhffsVLw.jpg","release_date":"1959-07-01","adult":false},{"id":60387,"title":"Operation Mad Ball","character":"Lt.
