{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"Raw Leiba was born in Newark, New Jersey to a Brazilian mother and an African American/Native American father. His father Robert was a US Army Veteran and served with the famed Tuskegee Airmen in WWII and his uncle is former NY Giant hall of famer Roosevelt Brown.  Leiba attended high school in NJ and later moved to Tempe, Arizona where he attended  High School. Possessing a 4.3 second 40 yard dash speed and a 44 inch vertical jump he soon got the attention of Arizona State University basketball assistant coaches and Head Football coach John Cooper. He signed with Arizona State under the condition that he be allowed to play both football and basketball for the school. After graduating he went to Spain to play professional basketball for Barcelona EL of the European League where he played a full season. After being waived in his second season Leiba took an invitation to the NFL San Diego Chargers mini-camp where he impressed coaches with his tremendous speed and leaping ability. He made the \"Practice Squad\" but was soon released when he told head coach Bobby Ross that he wanted to be an actor and could no longer commit to sports.  Leiba gained national attention when he won the the TLC'S reality action show Help Wanted, a spin-off of ABC TV'S The Next Action Hero, where competitors compete in acting and stunt roles. Leiba again showed his great athleticism and the guile that he is known for but coupled that with great acting ability.  Raw Leiba has gone on to do major movies and motion pictures and is also one of the top Sportsmodels in the world","homepage":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2836170/","id":226112,"imdb_id":"nm2836170","name":"Raw Leiba","popularity":1.008,"credits":{"cast":[{"id":57414,"title":"Ember Days","character":"Azazel","original_title":"Ember Days","release_date":"2013-03-05","adult":false},{"id":57462,"title":"Blood & Love","character":"Havoc","original_title":"Blood & Love","poster_path":"/uy2Syu9tgH0WAHvhbttetgV26uS.jpg","release_date":"2011-01-05","adult":false},{"id":57503,"title":"The Ascension","character":"Lando","original_title":"The Ascension","poster_path":"/yK6TDxQ52Gddwt5DbOU6AEzwSSi.jpg","release_date":"2011-11-30","adult":false},{"id":56555,"title":"Life Support","character":"Sportbike Gang Leader","original_title":"Life Support","poster_path":"/s5W14btMJb2EeZ8zND2jXeSokHr.jpg","release_date":"2007-03-10","adult":false},{"id":57511,"title":"Red,Right,Wrong","character":"The Dragon","original_title":"Red,Right,Wrong","release_date":"2009-09-15","adult":false},{"id":57584,"title":"The Legend of Hohokam","character":"","original_title":"The Legend of Hohokam","release_date":"","adult":false},{"id":315831,"title":"Day of the Gun","character":"Charlie Broken Hand","original_title":"Day of the Gun","release_date":"2013-11-14","adult":false},{"id":288809,"title":"Cybornetics","character":"Ice Morales","original_title":"Cybornetics","poster_path":"/nVyI35knZ05WzrlFEjKNqaCvWd1.jpg","release_date":"2012-01-01","adult":false},{"id":57509,"title":"Changing the Game","character":"Balu","original_title":"Changing the Game","release_date":"2012-12-31","adult":false},{"id":618370,"title":"比尔·蒂尔曼与不法之徒","character":"","original_title":"Bill Tilghman and the Outlaws","poster_path":"/zkc5mGLaB68YhSkvDOGi7Jy4bFV.jpg","release_date":"2019-02-07","adult":false},{"id":53529,"title":"Cover","character":"Man whistling to Zahara Milton","original_title":"Cover","poster_path":"/cXuY48wvXyXUIuSADiCNMoj0tSb.jpg","release_date":"2007-05-08","adult":false},{"id":449753,"title":"Human Zoo","character":"Contestant 1812","original_title":"Human Zoo","poster_path":"/bzTV8zQyqFOwIaU9TqlfOjOpL6s.jpg","release_date":"2020-05-05","adult":false},{"id":294963,"title":"战斧骨","character":"Wolf Skull","original_title":"Bone Tomahawk","poster_path":"/cEvYuXA10XrpUwnzbkjb5IByTQM.jpg","release_date":"2015-10-23","adult":false},{"id":102362,"title":"死人的复仇","character":"Harry's Jamaican #2","original_title":"Dead Man Down","poster_path":"/8xWo2WE36JdBwlCmwvXM4bb5rBg.jpg","release_date":"2013-03-08","adult":false},{"id":37430,"title":"王者之剑","character":"Rexor","original_title":"Conan the Barbarian","poster_path":"/vR6PzXsOfewD1kei8gMbepvwWC6.jpg","release_date":"2011-08-17","adult":false}],"crew":[{"id":57503,"title":"The Ascension","original_title":"The Ascension","department":"Production","job":"Producer","poster_path":"/yK6TDxQ52Gddwt5DbOU6AEzwSSi.jpg","release_date":"2011-11-30","adult":false},{"id":57511,"title":"Red,Right,Wrong","original_title":"Red,Right,Wrong","department":"Production","job":"Producer","release_date":"2009-09-15","adult":false},{"id":57584,"title":"The Legend of Hohokam","original_title":"The Legend of Hohokam","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer","release_date":"","adult":false}]},"images":{"profiles":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"nm2836170","tvrage_id":0}}
