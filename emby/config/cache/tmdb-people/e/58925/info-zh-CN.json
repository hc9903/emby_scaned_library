{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"Lester Speight is a film and television actor best known for his portrayal of Terry Tate: Office Linebacker in a series of Reebok commercials that first aired during Super Bowl XXXVII in 2003. The spots feature Speight, a former All-American Football player himself, as a linebacker charged with the no-holds barred enforcement of office policies. The commercials achieved much critical acclaim and were ranked the most watched of the Super Bowl by The Hollywood Reporter. The popular character recently made a return appearance in a series of ads campaign in support of voting. Amongst the Office Linebacker's new tackles included former Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin.\n\nAs determined and hardworking on screen as a linebacker is on the field, Speight has appeared with such stars as Eddie Murphy, Damon Wayans, Anthony Anderson, and even Optimus Prime. His television work includes a recurring role on the ABC series \"My Wife and Kids,\" as well as guest starring appearance on \"Prison Break,\" \"Bones,\" and \"Cold Case.\" On the silver screen he has appeared in hit films such as \"Transformers: Dark of the Moon,\" \"Norbit,\" and \"Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay.\"\n\nAside from Terry Tate however, Speight is probably most recognized by fans of the Gears of War video game series for the XBOX 360. Speight won the G-Phoria award for Best Voiceover in 2007 by the G4 Network for his performance as Augustus Cole (AKA Cole Train), a character that was modeled after Speight and includes subtle allusions to the Office Linebacker.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: Lester Speight","birthday":"1963-01-07","id":58925,"imdb_id":"nm0711529","name":"Lester Speight","place_of_birth":"Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.","popularity":1.985,"profile_path":"/p7Grah3dcQSsWY2nrnZe7l1s9Md.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":612619,"title":"Street Dreams Los Angeles","character":"Attorney Thomas Johnson","original_title":"Street Dreams Los Angeles","poster_path":"/fEIfwCCgfhNDY6dErYbPI3Ul5bH.jpg","release_date":"2018-10-07","adult":false},{"id":289229,"title":"My Dad's a Soccer Mom","character":"Marion Casey","original_title":"My Dad's a Soccer Mom","poster_path":"/oRPsuFpCruy1WUR7nNVpVXLAtea.jpg","release_date":"2014-06-21","adult":false},{"id":253980,"title":"王者万岁","character":"Herman","original_title":"Marvel One-Shot: All Hail the King","poster_path":"/tDpud3Y3gWtmSdcVhN0t4WiwsIK.jpg","release_date":"2014-02-04","adult":false},{"id":583024,"title":"Resolution Song","character":"Marcus","original_title":"Resolution Song","poster_path":"/7YVc2aeCJ3mLYP5NrT0S3pTaM7f.jpg","release_date":"2018-02-06","adult":false},{"id":9757,"title":"糯米正傳","character":"Blue Latimore","original_title":"Norbit","poster_path":"/sExfA7YUSXQJRGmOZ9v52lxd16I.jpg","release_date":"2007-02-08","adult":false},{"id":44946,"title":"笨蛋","character":"Redrum","original_title":"Knucklehead","poster_path":"/lr8ea5YtZHafTkxHWb2OE5ZSEK.jpg","release_date":"2010-10-22","adult":false},{"id":419747,"title":"Halloweed","character":"Sheriff Johnson","original_title":"Halloweed","poster_path":"/4i3p97Nxiv1sZfbSj6S8yM3HvUT.jpg","release_date":"2016-10-18","adult":false},{"id":36496,"title":"Ring of Death","character":"The President / Milton Kennedy","original_title":"Ring of Death","poster_path":"/wTohGGmEFjJ8YPBZfD3wDRs9EYR.jpg","release_date":"2008-01-01","adult":false},{"id":38356,"title":"变形金刚3：月黑之时","character":"Eddie","original_title":"Transformers: Dark of the Moon","poster_path":"/pQbSTJFcb9kyFgz806pq5vy6Eh8.jpg","release_date":"2011-06-28","adult":false},{"id":355948,"title":"Call Me King","character":"Vincent","original_title":"Call Me King","poster_path":"/qtBjKz6BcS9ziwZaKvyF9eHNExv.jpg","release_date":"2017-09-04","adult":false},{"id":10623,"title":"致命摇篮","character":"Chambers's Club Doorman","original_title":"Cradle 2 the Grave","poster_path":"/28nNtUWf5I6InBLYVnnUWiNxyBn.jpg","release_date":"2003-02-28","adult":false},{"id":13411,"title":"Malibu's Most Wanted","character":"Gang Leader (uncredited)","original_title":"Malibu's Most Wanted","poster_path":"/bjYuoz2S8S1AED5QIMvmAi21drc.jpg","release_date":"2003-04-10","adult":false},{"id":43656,"title":"13 Moons","character":"Vincent","original_title":"13 Moons","release_date":"2002-08-30","adult":false},{"id":348391,"title":"Speech & Debate","character":"Scary Bouncer","original_title":"Speech & Debate","poster_path":"/x5K8dpvgb3C3GtCtQWo1PhUkXGP.jpg","release_date":"2017-04-07","adult":false},{"id":9563,"title":"挑战星期天","character":"Shark's Security Guard","original_title":"Any Given Sunday","poster_path":"/lRl3lspTUkTjWgyCm6KAJcTXict.jpg","release_date":"1999-12-16","adult":false}],"crew":[{"id":9383,"title":"透明人","original_title":"Hollow Man","department":"Crew","job":"Stunt Driver","poster_path":"/sd3qUIv5uoP2oTbqv66CzXSPjKG.jpg","release_date":"2000-08-04","adult":false}]},"images":{"profiles":[{"file_path":"/p7Grah3dcQSsWY2nrnZe7l1s9Md.jpg","width":333,"height":500,"aspect_ratio":0.666,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"nm0711529","freebase_mid":"/m/05d9jd","freebase_id":"/en/lester_speight","tvrage_id":0}}
