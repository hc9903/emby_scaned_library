{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Robert Shaen Dawe","Robert Shane","Bob Shayne"],"biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nRobert Shayne (October 4, 1900 – November 29, 1992), born Robert Shaen Dawe, was an American actor whose career lasted for over 60 years. He was best known for portraying Inspector Bill Henderson in the American television series Adventures of Superman.\n\nShayne became an actor after having worked as a reporter at the Illustrated Daily Tab in Miami, Florida. His initial acting experience came with repertory companies in Alabama, including the Birmingham Players.\n\nShayne's first Broadway appearance came by 1931 in The Rap. His other Broadway shows include Yellow Jack (1934), The Cat and the Canary (1935), Whiteoaks (1938), with Ethel Barrymore, and Without Love (1942), with Katharine Hepburn.\n\nShayne began his film career in 1934, appearing in two features. In 1942, he became a contract actor with Warner Bros.. He played many character roles in movies and television, including a film series of Warner Bros. featurettes called the \"Santa Fe Trail\" series such as Wagon Wheels West, and as a mad scientist in the 1953 horror film The Neanderthal Man.\n\nHe appears briefly in Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest, seated at a booth in a hotel bar, where his character meets Cary Grant's character, just as the latter is about to be kidnapped. He also had a small but pivotal role in the 1953 sci-fi classic Invaders From Mars as a scientist. He also enjoyed a brief rebirth in his career when he was cast as the blind newspaper vendor in The Flash television show. He was by this time actually blind and learned his lines by having his wife read them to him and then rehearse until he memorized them.\n\nShayne portrayed Police Inspector William \"Bill\" Henderson on the 1950s TV series Adventures of Superman. He appeared sporadically in the early episodes of the series, in part because he came under HUAC scrutiny and was briefly blacklisted on unproven and unspecific charges of association with Communism. As the program evolved, especially in the color episodes, he was brought into more and more of them, to the point where he was a regular on the series.","birthday":"1900-10-04","deathday":"1992-11-29","id":34726,"imdb_id":"nm0790171","name":"Robert Shayne","place_of_birth":"Yonkers, New York, USA","popularity":1.312,"profile_path":"/k7wIXDxBHZTRcc1bcr1qcQjWz7Z.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":28775,"title":"The Neanderthal Man","character":"Prof. Clifford Groves","original_title":"The Neanderthal Man","poster_path":"/4O0QUlDkbbJ9tSi0uCdnDXySEa4.jpg","release_date":"1953-06-19","adult":false},{"id":344050,"title":"Wagon Wheels West","character":"U.S. Marshal Frankie Wilson","original_title":"Wagon Wheels West","poster_path":"/fO3UWwimUTBlzhx7TrDMTIwQQJB.jpg","release_date":"1943-10-30","adult":false},{"id":582468,"title":"Oklahoma Outlaws","character":"Ned Kincaid","original_title":"Oklahoma Outlaws","poster_path":"/rr7ucleMYp04JQQUz3ow15XwmVG.jpg","release_date":"1943-09-14","adult":false},{"id":353805,"title":"Frontier Days","character":"Marshal Jim Blake","original_title":"Frontier Days","poster_path":"/31J6ApkUE1MVBwDfZmvslSiX6s1.jpg","release_date":"1945-12-08","adult":false},{"id":322177,"title":"Gun to Gun","character":"Steve Randall","original_title":"Gun to Gun","poster_path":"/xyNtIa0cNnvNaztQfE6jMvEvHnV.jpg","release_date":"1944-01-08","adult":false},{"id":601821,"title":"Roaring Guns","character":"Jared Whitney","original_title":"Roaring Guns","release_date":"1944-02-19","adult":false},{"id":29284,"title":"Murder Is My Beat","character":"Bert Rawley","original_title":"Murder Is My Beat","poster_path":"/yKnP4XNZ32VcpaqDFT4TasccNMz.jpg","release_date":"1955-02-27","adult":false},{"id":86901,"title":"The Face of Marble","character":"Dr. David Cochran","original_title":"The Face of Marble","poster_path":"/cQXL6iQyHBG0LGZierNfBetsHZw.jpg","release_date":"1946-01-19","adult":false},{"id":122205,"title":"Wife Wanted","character":"Bill Tyler","original_title":"Wife Wanted","poster_path":"/3Cd8qd4mdAhzMicef7x0eJp9LoE.jpg","release_date":"1946-11-02","adult":false},{"id":126059,"title":"Federal Man","character":"Chief Agent Charles Stuart","original_title":"Federal Man","release_date":"1950-01-01","adult":false},{"id":344824,"title":"I Ring Doorbells","character":"Dick Meadows","original_title":"I Ring Doorbells","release_date":"1946-02-28","adult":false},{"id":401173,"title":"The Strange Mrs. Crane","character":"Floyd Durant","original_title":"The Strange Mrs. Crane","poster_path":"/2uwUqm5TmESpNLgqRzsOUu6qjrq.jpg","release_date":"1948-10-07","adult":false},{"id":582026,"title":"Law of the Badlands","character":"Bob Tate","original_title":"Law of the Badlands","release_date":"1945-04-14","adult":false},{"id":180505,"title":"I Won't Play","character":"Chaplain aka 'Padre'","original_title":"I Won't Play","poster_path":"/hv47u4hihOHFJTOIAZ2PdBVDDP8.jpg","release_date":"1944-11-11","adult":false},{"id":139376,"title":"I Cover Big Town","character":"Chief Tom Blake","original_title":"I Cover Big Town","release_date":"1947-02-27","adult":false},{"id":223863,"title":"Wednesday's Child","character":"Howard Benson","original_title":"Wednesday's Child","release_date":"1934-10-26","adult":false},{"id":234119,"title":"King of the Carnival","character":"Jess Carter","original_title":"King of the Carnival","release_date":"1955-06-27","adult":false},{"id":238953,"title":"Mr. Walkie Talkie","character":"Capt.
