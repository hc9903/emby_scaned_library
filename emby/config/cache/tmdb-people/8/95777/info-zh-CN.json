{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"​From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nWilliam James \"Bill\" O'Reilly, Jr. (born September 10, 1949) is an American television host, author, syndicated columnist and political commentator. He is the host of the political commentary program The O'Reilly Factor on the Fox News Channel, which is the most watched cable news television program on American television. During the late 1970s and 1980s, he worked as a news reporter for various local television stations in the United States and eventually for CBS News and ABC News. From 1989 to 1995, he was anchor of the entertainment news program Inside Edition.\n\nO'Reilly is widely considered a conservative commentator, though some of his positions diverge from conservative orthodoxy (in particular his opposition to the death penalty). O'Reilly characterizes himself as a \"traditionalist\". O'Reilly is the author of nine books, and hosted The Radio Factor until early 2009.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Bill O'Reilly (political commentator), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","birthday":"1949-09-10","id":95777,"imdb_id":"nm0971123","name":"Bill O'Reilly","place_of_birth":"New York City, New York, U.S.","popularity":0.6,"credits":{"cast":[{"id":136553,"title":"The Rumble in the Air: Conditioned Auditorium","character":"Himself","original_title":"The Rumble in the Air: Conditioned Auditorium","release_date":"2012-10-06","adult":false},{"id":318376,"title":"Bold & Fresh Tour 2010","character":"Bill O'Reilly","original_title":"Bold & Fresh Tour 2010","poster_path":"/rBuOLDZUx8PUlOPzlIkhOD8XKXg.jpg","release_date":"2010-01-30","adult":false},{"id":38608,"title":"Power Trip","character":"Himself","original_title":"Power Trip","release_date":"2003-12-17","adult":false},{"id":26607,"title":"WMD: Weapons of Mass Deception","character":"Himself","original_title":"WMD: Weapons of Mass Deception","poster_path":"/g7tzslAYU6OkuIgZeGMn8WdzNvu.jpg","release_date":"2004-12-12","adult":false},{"id":13372,"title":"Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism","character":"Himself (archive footage)","original_title":"Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism","release_date":"2004-07-14","adult":false},{"id":130774,"title":"Last Ounce of Courage","character":"Himself","original_title":"Last Ounce of Courage","poster_path":"/ozzB0mH3DjdNCUO8LeKPI42qXwp.jpg","release_date":"2012-09-14","adult":false},{"id":38507,"title":"Blood and Oil","character":"Himself","original_title":"Blood and Oil","release_date":"2008-06-13","adult":false},{"id":13948,"title":"An American Carol","character":"Himself","original_title":"An American Carol","poster_path":"/uEDdzt1ZTB1BRo95gMkBytl0NqM.jpg","release_date":"2008-10-03","adult":false},{"id":277606,"title":"Out in the Night","character":"Himself","original_title":"Out in the Night","poster_path":"/biN8OrCIemuctUaWIXNWOvqK01H.jpg","release_date":"2014-06-12","adult":false},{"id":38356,"title":"变形金刚3：月黑之时","character":"Bill O'Reilly","original_title":"Transformers: Dark of the Moon","poster_path":"/pQbSTJFcb9kyFgz806pq5vy6Eh8.jpg","release_date":"2011-06-28","adult":false},{"id":565719,"title":"撒旦万岁？","character":"Himself (archive footage)","original_title":"Hail Satan?","poster_path":"/lwP8CMOfPJhkMyxELgX2D2aDZfy.jpg","release_date":"2019-04-17","adult":false},{"id":10138,"title":"钢铁侠2","character":"Bill O'Reilly","original_title":"Iron Man 2","poster_path":"/yvAg9ewRkF8sh85K23CWEx5w3Er.jpg","release_date":"2010-04-28","adult":false}],"crew":[{"id":235093,"title":"刺杀肯尼迪","original_title":"Killing Kennedy","department":"Writing","job":"Story","poster_path":"/oKhgsXzQggIcSO4lOdj1q7cr3Lr.jpg","release_date":"2013-11-10","adult":false},{"id":413349,"title":"Killing Reagan","original_title":"Killing Reagan","department":"Writing","job":"Story","poster_path":"/xuw2VrzihZKHVLUQOJFS3xwaIMb.jpg","release_date":"2016-10-16","adult":false},{"id":170039,"title":"刺杀林肯","original_title":"Killing Lincoln","department":"Writing","job":"Story","poster_path":"/r1VP7Dt3uwHZoXCpwrN8RVlpO2E.jpg","release_date":"2013-02-16","adult":false},{"id":332356,"title":"Killing Jesus","original_title":"Killing Jesus","department":"Writing","job":"Story","poster_path":"/d21tZuxKPlagaVVf37Jg3hKDYRX.jpg","release_date":"2015-04-05","adult":false}]},"images":{"profiles":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"nm0971123","freebase_mid":"/m/019t77","freebase_id":"/en/bill_oreilly","tvrage_id":58857}}
