{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Stephen Culp","Steven Bradford Culp "],"biography":"An actor, known for Thirteen Days (2000) as Robert F. Kennedy, JAG (1995) as CIA Agent Clayton Webb and Desperate Housewives (2004) as Rex Van de Kamp. Despite being killed-off in season 1, Rex has appeared since in every season (excluding season 4 and 6). During the 2003-04 television season, the hardworking Culp successfully juggled recurring roles on an unheard of four series at one time: on CBS's JAG (1995) (as CIA Agent Clayton Webb), NBC's The West Wing (1999) (as GOP Speaker of the House Jeff Haffley), NBC's long-running hospital drama ER (1994) (as schoolteacher Dave Spencer), and on UPN's futuristic series Star Trek: Enterprise (2001) (as MACO commander Major Hayes). He also managed to squeeze in guest spots on The Lyon's Den (2003) and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000). At the end of that season, Culp had the unusual misfortune to have two of his characters (Webb on JAG and Major Hayes on Star Trek: Enterprise) killed off in the shows' season finales the same week (though Webb turned up very much alive in the subsequent season premiere of JAG). In 2013 Culp joined the cast of NBC's post-apocalyptic drama Revolution (2012) as the clean-cut Patriot Edward Truman, a dignified authority figure. Culp has been married to Barbara Ayers since September 29, 1990. They have two children.","birthday":"1955-12-03","id":63544,"imdb_id":"nm0191688","name":"Steven Culp","place_of_birth":"La Jolla - San Diego - California - USA","popularity":1.864,"profile_path":"/ssTkFDWr3O3N1nnU1Hn8SxaMs63.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":38510,"title":"How to Make a Monster","character":"Drummond","original_title":"How to Make a Monster","poster_path":"/1SYUhLRAe2hgw47aBWMxUG7f97X.jpg","release_date":"2001-10-14","adult":false},{"id":180318,"title":"The Chicago 8","character":"Thomas Foran","original_title":"The Chicago 8","release_date":"2011-06-04","adult":false},{"id":607111,"title":"Collusions","character":"Agent Robinson","original_title":"Collusions","poster_path":"/exNDk3QrCtJrMEblthzXMXmsqrl.jpg","release_date":"","adult":false},{"id":10285,"title":"十三号星期五9","character":"Robert Campbell","original_title":"Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday","poster_path":"/Aacq05foqiWdXqetFv02HBvMoJy.jpg","release_date":"1993-08-13","adult":false},{"id":238292,"title":"Murder, She Wrote: A Story to Die For","character":"William Batsby","original_title":"Murder, She Wrote: A Story to Die For","poster_path":"/i1oElT1JYpcjcnu69aHrBVxRG77.jpg","release_date":"2000-05-18","adult":false},{"id":144903,"title":"Deck the Halls","character":"Dr. Olsen","original_title":"Deck the Halls","poster_path":"/w3d7DdguO44aP3k4EDYfOPT0pjS.jpg","release_date":"2005-08-05","adult":false},{"id":218506,"title":"Donor Unknown","character":"Joel","original_title":"Donor Unknown","poster_path":"/43n3cdw3vV1TPQCbRfWzl32oSwf.jpg","release_date":"1995-11-01","adult":false},{"id":10107,"title":"Firehouse Dog","character":"Zachary Hayden","original_title":"Firehouse Dog","poster_path":"/q6wm2pmx8WiYrNa1vbCaabCUDcD.jpg","release_date":"2007-04-04","adult":false},{"id":10539,"title":"飞天巨桃历险记","character":"James' Father","original_title":"James and the Giant Peach","poster_path":"/3p7pCYiPdqWHKz5JLr4i0B1pAcZ.jpg","release_date":"1996-04-12","adult":false},{"id":16167,"title":"由内而外","character":"Pastor joe","original_title":"From Within","poster_path":"/kbZ5mKCpQvcKwGzsvataPKeUXJy.jpg","release_date":"2009-03-31","adult":false},{"id":46283,"title":"The Sisters","character":"Dr. Harry Glass","original_title":"The Sisters","release_date":"2005-04-23","adult":false},{"id":396810,"title":"最后的话","character":"Sam Serman","original_title":"The Last Word","poster_path":"/zHQfmycDriG8swK4opzepi3QhF0.jpg","release_date":"2017-03-03","adult":false},{"id":425585,"title":"A Walton Thanksgiving Reunion","character":"Jeff Dulaney","original_title":"A Walton Thanksgiving Reunion","release_date":"1993-11-21","adult":false},{"id":41127,"title":"双面玛丽莲","character":"Robert Kennedy","original_title":"Norma Jean & Marilyn","release_date":"1996-05-18","adult":false},{"id":11973,"title":"惊爆十三天","character":"Robert F.
