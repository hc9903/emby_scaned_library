{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nDaniel Eugene Butler (born December 2, 1954) is an American playwright and actor known for his role as Bob \"Bulldog\" Briscoe on the TV series Frasier.\n\nButler was born in Huntington, Indiana and raised in Fort Wayne; the son of Shirley, a homemaker, and Andrew Butler, a pharmacist. Openly gay, he starred in Terrence McNally's 1989 play The Lisbon Traviata and wrote an Off Broadway play about his life, The Only Thing Worse You Could Have Told Me..., which derives its title from a comment Butler's father allegedly made when Dan came out to him.\n\nThough Butler never hid his homosexuality, he disclosed it publicly on Entertainment Tonight in 1994 during his run as a swaggering heterosexual on Frasier.\n\nHis partner is acting teacher and director, Richard Waterhouse.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Dan Butler, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","birthday":"1954-12-02","id":76470,"imdb_id":"nm0124873","name":"Dan Butler","place_of_birth":"Huntington, Indiana, USA","popularity":1.349,"profile_path":"/eojKA4OavZ6814jghXCLSV2CN4G.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":135787,"title":"The Silver Screen: Color Me Lavender","character":"Host / Narrator","original_title":"The Silver Screen: Color Me Lavender","poster_path":"/s1TjxmFqj63rhvXq9zR4oo8UKXj.jpg","release_date":"1997-11-01","adult":false},{"id":442905,"title":"The Sissy Duckling","character":"Elmer","original_title":"The Sissy Duckling","poster_path":"/j3KjZDDHoFfRRlhRIf8EzsKUEAr.jpg","release_date":"1999-09-14","adult":false},{"id":21634,"title":"天佑鲍比","character":"Reverend Whitsell","original_title":"Prayers for Bobby","poster_path":"/1viFwXluAettogGDsTrSUUg29lZ.jpg","release_date":"2009-02-27","adult":false},{"id":91443,"title":"Chronic Town","character":"Blow Job","original_title":"Chronic Town","poster_path":"/trLUlHdOiu6aFBRmk6kDaxatXp.jpg","release_date":"2008-04-03","adult":false},{"id":267416,"title":"The Assassination File","character":"Harvey Young","original_title":"The Assassination File","poster_path":"/3xXY3mjeV0cnwXtbtzIMXNeLxs4.jpg","release_date":"1996-06-22","adult":false},{"id":14245,"title":"双狙人2","character":"Eckles","original_title":"Sniper 2","poster_path":"/dmHfc2h9bpCFOloUj54jntM0c9L.jpg","release_date":"2002-12-28","adult":false},{"id":23855,"title":"The First $20 Million Is Always the Hardest","character":"Lloyd Acheson","original_title":"The First $20 Million Is Always the Hardest","poster_path":"/mPW9AdDakbPKSPv0emzw64Jence.jpg","release_date":"2002-06-28","adult":false},{"id":318909,"title":"The Rape of Doctor Willis","character":"Styvesant","original_title":"The Rape of Doctor Willis","release_date":"1991-11-03","adult":false},{"id":11454,"title":"孽欲杀人夜","character":"Jimmy Price","original_title":"Manhunter","poster_path":"/6rb24x39vV8n5301IelC8rCPJTH.jpg","release_date":"1986-08-14","adult":false},{"id":39934,"title":"Longtime Companion","character":"Walter","original_title":"Longtime Companion","poster_path":"/lHIGo1VI71DQgDbbm6XWBjaPxCz.jpg","release_date":"1989-10-11","adult":false},{"id":10879,"title":"我爱麻烦","character":"Wilson Chess","original_title":"I Love Trouble","poster_path":"/hcpiVUby3AmbdPu4sQKZ37HK7Ps.jpg","release_date":"1994-06-29","adult":false},{"id":9566,"title":"狂迷","character":"Garrity","original_title":"The Fan","poster_path":"/lu7CjP8YES5dJMCFg5O9o9jCkjl.jpg","release_date":"1996-08-15","adult":false},{"id":439058,"title":"Hey Arnold!
