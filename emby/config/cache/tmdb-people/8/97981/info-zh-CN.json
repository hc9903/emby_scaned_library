{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Patrick C. Fitzgerald","Patrick Fitzgerald"],"biography":"From Wikipedia\n\nCreighton Hale (24 May 1888 — 9 August 1965) was an Irish-American theatre, film, and television actor whose career extended more than a half-century, from the early 1900s to the end of the 1950s.\n\nBorn Patrick Fitzgerald in County Cork, Ireland, he was educated in Dublin and London, and later attended Ardingly College in Sussex. He immigrated to America in his early twenties, traveling with a troupe of actors. While starring in Charles Frohman's Broadway production of Indian Summer, Hale was spotted by a representative of the Pathe Film Company. He eventually became known professionally as Creighton Hale, although the derivation of those names remains unknown. His first movie was The Exploits of Elaine in 1914. He starred in hit films such as Way Down East, Orphans of the Storm, and The Cat and the Canary.\n\nWhen talkies came about, his career declined. He made several appearances in Hal Roach's Our Gang series (School's Out, Big Ears, Free Wheeling), and also played unbilled bits in major talking films such as Larceny, Inc., The Maltese Falcon, and Casablanca.\n\nHe died in the Los Angeles County city of South Pasadena and was buried at Duncans Mills Cemetery in Northern California.\n\n[TMDb FYI add-on note: While online sites differ regarding Mr. Hale's birth year, the United States Social Security Death Index indicates that he was born in 1888. When during his lifetime issuing Mr. Hale a Social Security number, the Social Security Administration would have required him to submit documentation proof, or sworn affadavits, of his accurate and true birth date, and his other identifying details. Thus, the SSDI can be considered credible reliable verification of Mr. Hale's 1888 birth year.]","birthday":"1888-05-24","deathday":"1965-08-09","id":97981,"imdb_id":"nm0354878","name":"Creighton
