After a stage career in Australia, on Broadway and in Britain, he appeared in 321 films between 1909 and 1942.\n\nBracey was born in Melbourne, Victoria, with the name Sidney Bracy, later changing the spelling of his last name. He was the son of Welsh tenor Henry Bracy and English actress Clara T. Bracy. His aunt was actress and dancer Lydia Thompson.\n\nHe began his stage career in Australia in the 1890s, with J. C. Williamson's comic opera companies. On Broadway, in 1900, he appeared as the tenor lead, Yussuf, in the first American production of The Rose of Persia at Daly's Theatre in New York. He then moved to England, appearing as Moreno in the Edwardian musical comedy hit The Toreador at the Gaiety Theatre, London in June 1901. He next joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company on tour in Britain, playing Terence O'Brian in The Emerald Isle from September 1901 to May 1902. He then left the D'Oyly Carte, continuing his stage career in Britain. He appeared in Amorelle at London's Comedy Theatre in 1904, The Winter's Tale in 1904–05, and A Persian Princess at Queen's Theatre in 1909.\n\nBack on Broadway, in 1912, he played as Sir Guy of Gisborne in a revival of Reginald de Koven's Robin Hood at the New Amsterdam Theatre, followed by Rob Roy at the Liberty Theatre in 1913. He then moved into film acting, making first silent films and then \"talkies\", until his death in 1942. Early in his film career, he wrote and directed a silent movie called Sid Nee's Finish, (Thanhouser Company (1914), in which he played the title character. In 1916, he changed the spelling of his last name to \"Bracey\". Silent film authority Diane MacIntyre gave this description of him: \"Bracey, a stately looking character man, was in big demand for authority like roles; such as movie directors, bosses and, most of the time, the most respectable and poised butler in all of Hollywood. He was thin, dark haired and had an earnest, yet sober, face that could break into a look of wide-eyed exasperation.\"\n\nBracy died in Hollywood, California on 5 August 1942, aged 64.","birthday":"1877-12-18","deathday":"1942-08-05","id":80546,"imdb_id":"nm0102718","name":"Sidney Bracey","place_of_birth":"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","popularity":2.18,"credits":{"cast":[{"id":234249,"title":"The Littlest Diplomat","character":"Adjutant Potter","original_title":"The Littlest Diplomat","poster_path":"/x8qgDdDLcxR3IavdPtGh6xeTnxd.jpg","release_date":"1937-09-06","adult":false},{"id":555465,"title":"Elusive Isabel","character":"Luiigi","original_title":"Elusive Isabel","poster_path":"/tbIvChdGKH0rFQ6ua0sCaREliys.jpg","release_date":"1916-05-15","adult":false},{"id":31411,"title":"摄影师","character":"Editor","original_title":"The Cameraman","poster_path":"/prhMP7VVxpQTzOFIPsbnr41IDTN.jpg","release_date":"1928-09-10","adult":false},{"id":42638,"title":"女王凯莱","character":"Prince Wolfram's Lackey","original_title":"Queen Kelly","poster_path":"/57fAD3B9KzHyEQ1KE9dsu6elSjg.jpg","release_date":"1929-01-01","adult":false},{"id":440644,"title":"Changing of the Guard","character":"Grayson, the Butler","original_title":"Changing of the Guard","release_date":"1936-06-05","adult":false},{"id":174098,"title":"Zudora","character":"Tom Hunt","original_title":"Zudora","poster_path":"/8XyK7UXl1QjcjyVKorzERaXdN5Q.jpg","release_date":"1914-11-20","adult":false},{"id":191912,"title":"Uncle's Namesake","character":"Uncle John","original_title":"Uncle's Namesake","release_date":"1913-12-11","adult":false},{"id":600669,"title":"The Huntress of Men","character":"","original_title":"The Huntress of Men","poster_path":"/A3mBAxbzAXzwAB3NjWm3Yb5IZXg.jpg","release_date":"1916-05-08","adult":false},{"id":171629,"title":"The Second Floor Mystery","character":"Alfred","original_title":"The Second Floor Mystery","release_date":"1930-04-26","adult":false},{"id":208527,"title":"A Night at the Movies","character":"Movie Patron (uncredited)","original_title":"A Night at the Movies","poster_path":"/ryVf71ENP3w0s2UrYW3b2IC1EiZ.jpg","release_date":"1937-11-06","adult":false},{"id":333435,"title":"The Airmail Mystery","character":"Driscoll","original_title":"The Airmail Mystery","release_date":"1932-03-28","adult":false},{"id":222251,"title":"Back Page","character":"Edgar Ashe","original_title":"Back Page","poster_path":"/rEy5YBCGncrh82HeBI1uQjDkb9r.jpg","release_date":"1934-06-01","adult":false},{"id":233633,"title":"A Bankrupt Honeymoon","character":"The Butler","original_title":"A Bankrupt Honeymoon","release_date":"1926-02-06","adult":false},{"id":295972,"title":"His Captive Woman","character":"","original_title":"His Captive Woman","poster_path":"/odiqOGmrrtAZYu14Ib4AKbGmEYR.jpg","release_date":"1929-02-03","adult":false},{"id":186431,"title":"Her Night of Romance","character":"Butler","original_title":"Her Night of Romance","release_date":"1924-11-24","adult":false},{"id":407684,"title":"Birds of Prey","character":"Gaston","original_title":"Birds of Prey","release_date":"1927-03-27","adult":false},{"id":95560,"title":"The Monster Walks","character":"Herbert Wilkes (as Sidney Bracy)","original_title":"The Monster Walks","poster_path":"/fL2SMsSjTuXX2qaB3KSzrXgxFVb.jpg","release_date":"1932-02-10","adult":false},{"id":438663,"title":"Painting the Town","character":"Secretary","original_title":"Painting the Town","release_date":"1927-08-07","adult":false},{"id":679170,"title":"The 13th Juror","character":"The Butler","original_title":"The 13th Juror","poster_path":"/1IhSXdi0uATiUjOcRjxu8giFYCX.jpg","release_date":"1927-11-13","adult":false},{"id":699362,"title":"The Dictator","character":"Henry Bolton","original_title":"The Dictator","release_date":"1922-06-25","adult":false},{"id":285226,"title":"The Million Dollar Mystery","character":"","original_title":"The Million Dollar Mystery","poster_path":"/9usEwvPANatb47jqXvQHASWtPsL.jpg","release_date":"1914-01-02","adult":false},{"id":36783,"title":"The Greeks Had a Word for Them","character":"The Waiter","original_title":"The Greeks Had a Word for Them","poster_path":"/7K8Jf1zUafBoBIMfdRH6RoA4ey2.jpg","release_date":"1932-02-03","adult":false},{"id":223406,"title":"Broken Dreams","character":"Hopkins","original_title":"Broken Dreams","poster_path":"/cHsDn14IdlPxwvebwYtE0jFn8DZ.jpg","release_date":"1933-10-19","adult":false},{"id":199034,"title":"The Intruder","character":"Carlo -
