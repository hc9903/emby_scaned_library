{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Guy G. Way","Guy Gifford Way"],"biography":"A somewhat chubby but menacing Guy Way played a frequent heavy in movies and television. During the 1960s you could catch him on numerous shows from Mission Impossible to The Man From Uncle. Once in a while he did get a few lines as with The Sting in 1973, where he takes Robert Redford at the roulette table. In 1967, as a prison guard he addresses Robert Blake as he is about to be hung in the classic In Cold Blood. And he was a cop that helps chase Kevin McCarthy back in the 50s with Invasion Of The Body Snatchers.","birthday":"1924-01-28","deathday":"2009-01-15","id":101484,"imdb_id":"nm0915429","name":"Guy Way","place_of_birth":" Detroit, Michigan, USA","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/pxp7U3N0RrEBLP6CZvHqJOCIHYV.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":65585,"title":"Batgirl","character":"Mothman #3","original_title":"Batgirl","poster_path":"/axzFckzGakSTvN5Nc2TQLQeTcU5.jpg","release_date":"1967-01-01","adult":false},{"id":11549,"title":"天外魔花","character":"Officer Sam Janzek","original_title":"Invasion of the Body Snatchers","poster_path":"/8BrMQmgwGzIHSyBjCDOLOdi79fJ.jpg","release_date":"1956-02-05","adult":false},{"id":102089,"title":"Sky Commando","character":"","original_title":"Sky Commando","poster_path":"/aPRYeHm1HPmq70LqNUcs92EfPY3.jpg","release_date":"1953-08-21","adult":false},{"id":15417,"title":"永不低头","character":"Bartender","original_title":"Every Which Way But Loose","poster_path":"/tcHqvDfTtxzUJVU3c8iGZtz4eyc.jpg","release_date":"1978-12-19","adult":false},{"id":9277,"title":"骗中骗","character":"Gambling Den Boss (uncredited)","original_title":"The Sting","poster_path":"/3Nlbq8TZjf29YZc6GBCyLkECLlg.jpg","release_date":"1973-12-25","adult":false},{"id":40686,"title":"Trouble Along the Way","character":"Football Player","original_title":"Trouble Along the Way","poster_path":"/x68I6WyWr8iACqUFgnCoPcLc3Gr.jpg","release_date":"1953-04-04","adult":false},{"id":31602,"title":"凯德警长","character":"Townsman (uncredited)","original_title":"The Chase","poster_path":"/nuDdNxWLKCNhX72WVfb7xf3ZKj8.jpg","release_date":"1966-02-17","adult":false},{"id":36912,"title":"骗中骗2","character":"Macalinski's Goon","original_title":"The Sting II","poster_path":"/y2Kpm60wfXcqdXdUbo7aEa5HLCb.jpg","release_date":"1983-02-18","adult":false},{"id":2661,"title":"蝙蝠侠","character":"Guinea Pig #2 (uncredited)","original_title":"Batman","poster_path":"/jV4grL9Sxd2QA6oCOyIzdmVAJvp.jpg","release_date":"1966-07-30","adult":false}],"crew":[]},"images":{"profiles":[{"file_path":"/pxp7U3N0RrEBLP6CZvHqJOCIHYV.jpg","width":300,"height":450,"aspect_ratio":0.66666666666667,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"nm0915429","tvrage_id":0}}
