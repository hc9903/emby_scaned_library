David Ogden Stiers, White's co-star from Beauty and the Beast, provided Ratcliffe's voice.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Richard White(actor), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","birthday":"1953-08-04","id":108055,"imdb_id":"nm0925369","name":"Richard White","place_of_birth":"Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA","popularity":1.799,"profile_path":"/ffrXvosdpVWd00neXUyposGNViF.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":44510,"title":"The Grandmother","character":"Mike","original_title":"The Grandmother","poster_path":"/llhiY0rV6RWU1LOdy9Zljhf7cXm.jpg","release_date":"1970-01-01","adult":false},{"id":10020,"title":"美女与野兽","character":"Gaston (voice)","original_title":"Beauty and the Beast","poster_path":"/ll8lx4WDtQdr9LtCSCCBxoyZzzE.jpg","release_date":"1991-11-13","adult":false},{"id":91339,"title":"Kill Zone","character":"Medic","original_title":"Kill Zone","release_date":"1993-01-01","adult":false},{"id":46624,"title":"The Short Films of David Lynch","character":"Mike","original_title":"The Short Films of David Lynch","poster_path":"/oJwWTPPgtQPljKZBz5MmUOo75nj.jpg","release_date":"2002-06-01","adult":false}],"crew":[]},"images":{"profiles":[{"file_path":"/ffrXvosdpVWd00neXUyposGNViF.jpg","width":826,"height":1239,"aspect_ratio":0.66666666666667,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"nm0925369","tvrage_id":0}}
