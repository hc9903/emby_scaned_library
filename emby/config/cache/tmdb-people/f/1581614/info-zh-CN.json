{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Alaïs Aviana Adell","Adelaide Alessi","  Angelique Alaïs Adell"],"biography":"Angelie Alaïs aka Angelique Alaïs Adell is an actress and writer. In the  manner of JK Rowling (Joanne K. Rowling) Angelique Alaïs published her  work under the initials of her first name or other pseudonyms. This was a  strategy in order to let it open whether the author was a man or a  woman. Best example: Harry Potter: The book should not appear under  Rowling's full name Joanne, because the publisher feared that boys would  not like to read books written by a woman. Rowling therefore decided to  use the initials \"J. K. \". Another feature that both writers have in  common: They write for feature films with fictional content in the area  of fantasy/ science fiction.","id":1581614,"imdb_id":"","name":"Adelaide Alaïs","popularity":0.6,"credits":{"cast":[{"id":60064,"title":"La lupa","character":"Filomena","original_title":"La lupa","poster_path":"/9kb4DIKcv8Tdnl7OwXkJ6eYJqET.jpg","release_date":"1996-01-01","adult":false},{"id":384180,"title":"Die Cellistin","character":"Nina","original_title":"Die Cellistin","release_date":"1998-01-14","adult":false},{"id":637,"title":"美丽人生","character":"German Auxilliary","original_title":"La vita è bella","poster_path":"/8X1hakO6bGVRIm1D90BkrSd7Ra6.jpg","release_date":"1997-12-20","adult":false}],"crew":[]},"images":{"profiles":[]},"external_ids":{"tvrage_id":0}}
