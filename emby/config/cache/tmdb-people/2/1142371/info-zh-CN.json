{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"From Wikipedia\n\nMaurice George Costello (February 22, 1877 – October 29,\n\n1950)[1] was an American prominent vaudeville actor of the late 1890s and early\n\n1900s, who later played a principal role in early American films, as both a\n\nleading man, supporting player and a director.\n\nCostello was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Irish\n\nimmigrants Ellen and Thomas Costello. He appeared in his first motion picture\n\nin 1905, in which he had the honour of appearing in the first serious film to\n\nfeature the character of Sherlock Holmes in the movie Adventures of Sherlock\n\nHolmes, in which Costello played the title role. He continued to work for\n\nVitagraph, being a member of the first motion picture stock company ever\n\nformed, playing opposite Florence Turner. Among some of his best known pictures\n\nare A Tale of Two Cities, The Man Who Couldn't Beat God and For the Honor of\n\nthe Family. After an absence of some years he returned to the screen. He was\n\nmarried to actress Mae Costello (née Altschuk). His descendants include two\n\ndaughters, actresses Dolores Costello and Helene Costello, a grandson John Drew\n\nBarrymore, and a great granddaughter Drew Barrymore. He was one of the world's\n\nfirst leading men in early American cinema, but like a lot of other silent\n\nscreen stars, he found the transition to \"talkies\" extremely\n\ndifficult, and his leading man status was over. However, Costello was a\n\ntrouper, and continued to appear in movies, often in small roles and bit parts,\n\nright up until his death in 1950.","birthday":"1877-02-22","deathday":"1950-10-29","id":1142371,"imdb_id":"nm0007221","name":"Maurice Costello","place_of_birth":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","popularity":1.02,"credits":{"cast":[{"id":160282,"title":"A Midsummer Night's Dream","character":"Lysander","original_title":"A Midsummer Night's Dream","poster_path":"/r8G3deHwLywwNzvSobiFZMNd1Qt.jpg","release_date":"1909-12-25","adult":false},{"id":233095,"title":"A Tale of Two Cities","character":"Sydney Carton","original_title":"A Tale of Two Cities","poster_path":"/4MmHdTP3Zn2srq3URxYVpeMQy5k.jpg","release_date":"1911-02-20","adult":false},{"id":286273,"title":"Richelieu; or: The Conspiracy","character":"","original_title":"Richelieu; or: The Conspiracy","release_date":"1910-01-02","adult":false},{"id":420123,"title":"When Persistency and Obstinacy Meet","character":"Henry Ford","original_title":"When Persistency and Obstinacy Meet","release_date":"1912-10-08","adult":false},{"id":337387,"title":"The Crimson Stain Mystery","character":"","original_title":"The Crimson Stain Mystery","release_date":"1916-08-21","adult":false},{"id":341904,"title":"The Picture Idol","character":"Howard Hanson","original_title":"The Picture Idol","release_date":"1912-05-31","adult":false},{"id":359181,"title":"Dr. LaFleur's Theory","character":"Dr. LaFleur","original_title":"Dr. LaFleur's Theory","release_date":"1912-05-05","adult":false},{"id":406548,"title":"Aunty's Romance","character":"Stephen Fiske Jr.","original_title":"Aunty's Romance","release_date":"1912-05-12","adult":false},{"id":406621,"title":"The Loyalty of Sylvia","character":"Dr. Dudley Lawrence","original_title":"The Loyalty of Sylvia","release_date":"1912-09-12","adult":false},{"id":406950,"title":"Delayed Proposals","character":"Jack Hardy","original_title":"Delayed Proposals","release_date":"1913-06-19","adult":false},{"id":407055,"title":"As You Like It","character":"Orlando","original_title":"As You Like It","release_date":"1912-10-06","adult":false},{"id":407093,"title":"The Lonely Princess","character":"Endicott, an American Millionaire","original_title":"The Lonely Princess","release_date":"1913-09-03","adult":false},{"id":419987,"title":"It All Came Out in the Wash","character":"Barry Wall","original_title":"It All Came Out in the Wash","release_date":"1912-12-29","adult":false},{"id":420007,"title":"Lulu's Doctor","character":"Doctor John Lewis","original_title":"Lulu's Doctor","release_date":"1912-06-09","adult":false},{"id":420014,"title":"The Meeting of the Ways","character":"Tom - an Honest Attorney","original_title":"The Meeting of the Ways","release_date":"1912-01-12","adult":false},{"id":420037,"title":"Mrs. 'Enry 'Awkins","character":"'Enry Awkins","original_title":"Mrs. 'Enry 'Awkins","release_date":"1912-03-13","adult":false},{"id":420089,"title":"The Show Girl","character":"Dr. Renfrew","original_title":"The Show Girl","release_date":"1911-05-18","adult":false},{"id":451875,"title":"The Crown Prince's Double","character":"Prince Oscar / Barry Lawrence","original_title":"The Crown Prince's Double","release_date":"1916-02-07","adult":false},{"id":550856,"title":"Antony and Cléopatra","character":"Marc Antony","original_title":"Antony and Cléopatra","release_date":"1908-11-03","adult":false},{"id":625173,"title":"Rose Leaves","character":"","original_title":"Rose Leaves","release_date":"1910-08-27","adult":false},{"id":625174,"title":"Auld Lang Syne","character":"","original_title":"Auld Lang Syne","release_date":"1911-11-07","adult":false},{"id":674815,"title":"The Adventure of the Italian Model","character":"","original_title":"The Adventure of the Italian Model","release_date":"1912-09-21","adult":false},{"id":406558,"title":"The Old Silver Watch","character":"","original_title":"The Old Silver Watch","release_date":"1912-03-19","adult":false},{"id":699206,"title":"Proving His Love; or, The Ruse of a Beautiful Woman","character":"Lloyd Stanwood","original_title":"Proving His Love; or, The Ruse of a Beautiful Woman","release_date":"1911-06-16","adult":false},{"id":100247,"title":"Winsor McCay, the Famous Cartoonist of the N.Y.
