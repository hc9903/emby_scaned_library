{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nStanley Earl Kramer (September 29, 1913 – February 19, 2001) was an American film director and producer responsible for some of Hollywood's most famous \"message\" movies. His notable films include The Defiant Ones (1958), On the Beach (1959), Inherit the Wind (1960), Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963), Ship of Fools (1965) and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967). His work was recognized with the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award in 1961, and over the course of his career he received nine Academy Award nominations.\n\nDirector Steven Spielberg once described him as \"one of our great filmmakers, not just for the art and passion he put on screen, but for the impact he has made on the conscience of the world.\"[1] Film critic David Thomson described Kramer as a \"hero of the 1950s\" and an \"enterprising producer,\" but also wrote of his later films that \"commercialism, of the most crass and confusing kind, has devitalised all [of] his projects\".[\n\nDescription above from the
