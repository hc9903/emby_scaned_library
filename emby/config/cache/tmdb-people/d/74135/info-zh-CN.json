She's an artistic associate with Synchronicity Theatre and is currently working on a commission for Horizon Theatre, via a grant from the MAP fund. Her secret passion is providing scripts for teens to perform and to see; she'd like to be the John Hughes of High school Theatre...simply because she believes we should get them young. She's accomplished this with her two scripts, FISHBOWL and DESPERADOES.
