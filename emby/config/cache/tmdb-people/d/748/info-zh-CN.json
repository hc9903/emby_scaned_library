{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"Paul Maxwell (12 November 1921 – 19 December 1991) was a Canadian actor who worked mostly in British cinema and television, in which he was usually cast as American characters. In terms of audience, his most notable role was probably that of the ex-GI groom of Elsie Tanner in the character's 1967 wedding in the soap opera Coronation Street. In the 1960s, Maxwell appeared in many TV series produced by ITC Entertainment, such as Danger Man and The Baron. He also voiced North American characters in series filmed by Gerry Anderson's production company Century 21, most prominently the leading character of Colonel Steve Zodiac in Fireball XL5 (1962) and the supporting character of Captain Grey in Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons(1967). Maxwell also starred as the \"Man with the Panama Hat\" in the film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), as a C.I.A chief in The Pink Panther Strikes Again (1976), and as General Maxwell Taylor in A Bridge Too Far (1977). His real passion, however, was theatre; he starred in the West End several times, with roles in Twelve Angry Men and the musical Promises, Promises. After the Second World War, Maxwell married Mary Lindsay. The couple had one daughter, named Lindsay.","birthday":"1921-11-12","deathday":"1991-12-19","id":748,"imdb_id":"nm0561792","name":"Paul Maxwell","place_of_birth":"Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada","popularity":1.012,"credits":{"cast":[{"id":3690,"title":"City of Fear","character":"Mike Foster","original_title":"City of Fear","release_date":"1965-08-01","adult":false},{"id":256892,"title":"Freedom to Die","character":"Craig Owen","original_title":"Freedom to Die","poster_path":"/hFNxaAYLYh3h974Xr37MuriZ7HW.jpg","release_date":"1961-01-01","adult":false},{"id":512027,"title":"Shadow of Fear","character":"Bill Martin","original_title":"Shadow of Fear","poster_path":"/6qLWEHr4jbNvD6lbdT3tQESsPLd.jpg","release_date":"1963-07-01","adult":false},{"id":31232,"title":"It!","character":"Jim Perkins","original_title":"It!","poster_path":"/edfKmE9OJxLz0cMAi6Ks1WHM9KB.jpg","release_date":"1966-03-17","adult":false},{"id":393384,"title":"Felhővalcer","character":"Andrew Tolliver","original_title":"Felhővalcer","release_date":"1987-02-14","adult":false},{"id":368139,"title":"The Vision","character":"Bill Freed","original_title":"The Vision","poster_path":"/2JjFrfb1kvYXEtfdtmzL5WmuhmY.jpg","release_date":"1987-11-25","adult":false},{"id":55032,"title":"Madame Sin","character":"Connors","original_title":"Madame Sin","poster_path":"/6wJKkpiewKW5jt8ggGE83nd1jCM.jpg","release_date":"1972-01-15","adult":false},{"id":266258,"title":"The Man Outside","character":"Judson Murphy","original_title":"The Man Outside","release_date":"1967-08-24","adult":false},{"id":219838,"title":"Intrigue","character":"Esterbrook","original_title":"Intrigue","release_date":"1988-09-11","adult":false},{"id":35780,"title":"Thunderbirds are GO","character":"Captain Paul Travers (voice)","original_title":"Thunderbirds are GO","poster_path":"/tNGxCeZJtezGohEG8rVdMSEsSoJ.jpg","release_date":"1966-12-15","adult":false},{"id":235078,"title":"Baxter!","character":"Mr Baxter","original_title":"Baxter!","release_date":"1973-03-04","adult":false},{"id":499392,"title":"Shadow of Fear","character":"","original_title":"Shadow of Fear","poster_path":"/8rYXwd8LEpK1lnWa39818huKfH.jpg","release_date":"1974-01-28","adult":false},{"id":116327,"title":"How to Make a Monster","character":"Jeffrey Clayton","original_title":"How to Make a Monster","poster_path":"/wF9W1PkheTNX5DLIUgKv91J8KKr.jpg","release_date":"1958-07-01","adult":false},{"id":368161,"title":"Strong Medicine","character":"Mace","original_title":"Strong Medicine","release_date":"1986-01-01","adult":false},{"id":69862,"title":"We Joined the Navy","character":"Commander Spelling U.S.N.","original_title":"We Joined the Navy","poster_path":"/1uEuQFz1vabQkrMI7MkkfacJ9sO.jpg","release_date":"1963-05-17","adult":false},{"id":111752,"title":"Man in the Middle","character":"Major Smith","original_title":"Man in the Middle","poster_path":"/bKp5KFm1BGCUAye5qWIuezN2Bsg.jpg","release_date":"1963-10-01","adult":false},{"id":89,"title":"夺宝奇兵3：圣战奇兵","character":"Panama Hat","original_title":"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade","poster_path":"/sizg1AU8f8JDZX4QIgE4pjUMBvx.jpg","release_date":"1989-05-24","adult":false},{"id":139262,"title":"The Last Days of Patton","character":"Lt.Gen.
