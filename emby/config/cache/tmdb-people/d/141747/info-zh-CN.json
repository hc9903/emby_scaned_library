{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"Cast in four movies from director John McTiernan, including playing two different characters in the 1st and 3rd \"Die Hard\" film.  Had one son, Michael Pecchio.  According to director John McTiernan in his DVD commentary for 'Die Hard' when he met Anthony Peck the actor was working as a waiter in between roles. He cast Peck as one of the cops in 'Die Hard' and was so impressed with what he was able to do with such a small role he later gave him a much larger part as a naval officer in 'The Hunt for Red October'. This exposure lead to Peck playing a series of lucrative roles as police officers in big budget productions such as 'The Last Action Hero', 'In the Line of Fire' and returning to the Die Hard series in 'Die Hard with a Vengence'.","birthday":"1947-03-20","deathday":"1996-07-30","id":141747,"imdb_id":"nm0669625","name":"Anthony Peck","place_of_birth":"Ohio, USA ","popularity":1.96,"credits":{"cast":[{"id":55667,"title":"Carnosaur 3: Primal Species","character":"Gen.
