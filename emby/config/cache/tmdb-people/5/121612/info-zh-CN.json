During the filming of the movie, he met actress Angela Alvarado who would later become his wife. In the 1990s he helped launch Ricky Martin's musical career into a new global setting by writing and producing various of his hottest singles including María, La Vida Loca, La Copa de La Vida, She Bangs, and Shake Your Bon-Bon. Rosa toured with Lenny Kravitz during the summer of 2004 to promote his concept album Mad Love.\n\nIn April 2011, Rosa was diagnosed with a non-hodgkin lymphoma cancer near his liver. He underwent alternative and traditional treatment in Houston and Santa Monica. This kept Rosa in a hiatus for almost a year until his return in March 2012, when he started recording his latest album with \"Vida\", and gave a concert with Juan Luis Guerra and Rubén Blades at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico Jose Miguel Agrelot. In December 2012, he was declared cancer-free. On December 9, 2013, Rosa's manager confirmed his cancer had relapsed and was declared again cancer-free on January 5, 2014.","birthday":"1970-06-27","homepage":"http://dracorosa.com/","id":121612,"imdb_id":"nm0740875","name":"Robi Draco Rosa","place_of_birth":"Ponce, Puerto Rico","popularity":0.6,"credits":{"cast":[{"id":38909,"title":"Salsa","character":"Rico","original_title":"Salsa","poster_path":"/e57jcyyQYKDruSuoy7g7alsjbrd.jpg","release_date":"1988-07-09","adult":false},{"id":328179,"title":"Robi Draco Rosa - Al Natural","character":"Robby Rosa","original_title":"Robi Draco Rosa - Al Natural","release_date":"2005-12-06","adult":false},{"id":395670,"title":"Encuentro","character":"","original_title":"Encuentro","release_date":"2002-12-08","adult":false},{"id":395757,"title":"Lo mejor de nuestra música popular: 15 años de éxitos","character":"","original_title":"Lo mejor de nuestra música popular: 15 años de éxitos","release_date":"2007-12-02","adult":false},{"id":2205,"title":"Gummibärchen küßt man nicht","character":"Peter","original_title":"Gummibärchen küßt man nicht","release_date":"1989-08-17","adult":false}],"crew":[{"id":328179,"title":"Robi Draco Rosa - Al Natural","original_title":"Robi Draco Rosa - Al Natural","department":"Directing","job":"Director","release_date":"2005-12-06","adult":false}]},"images":{"profiles":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"nm0740875","tvrage_id":0}}
