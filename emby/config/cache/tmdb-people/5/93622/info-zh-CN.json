{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Frank Randolph Cady"],"biography":"Although Frank Cady's most famous role would be that of general-store owner Sam Drucker, one of the less nutty residents of Hooterville in both Green Acres (1965) and Petticoat Junction (1963), he had a history as a film, stage and television actor long before those shows. Cady also appeared on some radio programs including Gunsmoke.\n\nIn the 1950s, Cady played Doc Williams in The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet (1952), along with numerous supporting parts in movies and also appeared in television commercials for (among other products) Shasta Grape Soda. Cady has been most prolific in television and was the only actor to play a recurring character on three TV sitcoms at the same time, The Beverly Hillbillies (1962), Green Acres (1965), and Petticoat Junction (1963). Usually cast as a gregarious small-town businessman, druggist, store clerk or other type of all-around Midwestern-type good guy, Cady was actually a California native, born in Susanville in 1915.\n\nThe acting bug bit him when he sang in an elementary school play, and after graduating from Stanford University he headed to London, England, to train in the theater.\n\nWhen World War II broke out he was already in Europe, so he enlisted in the Army Air Force and spent the next several years in postings all over the continent. After his discharge he returned to the US and headed for Hollywood.\n\nAn agent saw him in a local play, signed him, and he was on his way. One of his earlier--and more atypical--roles was as a seedy underworld character pulled in for questioning in a cop's murder in the noir classic He Walked by Night (1948), and he played a succession of hotel clerks, bureaucrats, henpecked husbands and the like for the next 40+ years. He did much television work from the mid-'50s onward.\n\nCady resided in Wilsonville, Oregon and at the time of his death had two children, three grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.","birthday":"1915-09-08","deathday":"2012-06-08","id":93622,"imdb_id":"nm0128326","name":"Frank Cady","place_of_birth":"Susanville, California, USA","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/dZKTpt8V4Aw0UnzA1f1qOez4NDC.jpg","credits":{"cast":[{"id":198557,"title":"Half a Hero","character":"Mr. Watts","original_title":"Half a Hero","release_date":"1953-05-11","adult":false},{"id":701782,"title":"The History of Hooterville","character":"Self","original_title":"The History of Hooterville","poster_path":"/uWYN645toH16cSE08M2zFttwRKu.jpg","release_date":"2005-10-19","adult":false},{"id":25364,"title":"倒扣的王牌","character":"Mr. Federber","original_title":"Ace in the Hole","poster_path":"/1NwZ6Sx4Eq7eT02abcI7YqfXdJk.jpg","release_date":"1951-06-29","adult":false},{"id":16380,"title":"When Worlds Collide","character":"Harold Ferris","original_title":"When Worlds Collide","poster_path":"/yqzLKj18RzFL0CNWQOe9QzfoL4x.jpg","release_date":"1951-09-14","adult":false},{"id":24002,"title":"Let's Make It Legal","character":"Ferguson","original_title":"Let's Make It Legal","poster_path":"/9YThjR3eWeyPzeALTIwr6hovQ1U.jpg","release_date":"1951-10-31","adult":false},{"id":96337,"title":"Zandy's Bride","character":"Pa Allan","original_title":"Zandy's Bride","poster_path":"/3OCoGjXYTA2cbzN5lvLiAnGT2KJ.jpg","release_date":"1974-05-19","adult":false},{"id":239175,"title":"The Man Who Understood Women","character":"John Milstead","original_title":"The Man Who Understood Women","poster_path":"/goDcWacIErPzOj27yv7D9Fylcg3.jpg","release_date":"1959-10-02","adult":false},{"id":246786,"title":"The Checkered Coat","character":"Skinner","original_title":"The Checkered Coat","release_date":"1948-07-16","adult":false},{"id":380382,"title":"Bungalow 13","character":"Gus Barton","original_title":"Bungalow 13","release_date":"1948-11-19","adult":false},{"id":86769,"title":"The Atomic City","character":"F.B.I.
