Since he left, he has directed several films (the most notable being Sorority Boys).\n\nAccording to DVD commentary for the season 9 episode, \"Miracle on Evergreen Terrace\", Wolodarsky had a wiffle ball bat that read \"I KEELL YOU!\" which was one of the threats spray-painted on The Simpsons' car after the family is shunned by the town for lying to them about a robber stealing the family's Christmas tree.\n\nThe character \"Vladimir Wolodarsky\" in The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou was named after him. He has roles in Rushmore and The Darjeeling Limited, and is a voice actor in Fantastic Mr. Fox.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Wallace Wolodarsky, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list
